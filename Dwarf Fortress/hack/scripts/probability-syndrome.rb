# probability-syndrome.rb - Run commands with a certain probability
#
# = DESCRIPTION
#
# Including the PROBABILITY_TABLE stone in our reaction causes the
# probability-syndrome script to scan it, build a probability table, and
# execute one command according to the weightings listed
# 
# For example the following would effectively roll 1d5,
# and initiate an ambush by elves, humans, drow, dwarves,
# or have no effect, based upon the result.
