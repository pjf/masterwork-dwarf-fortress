This is my [CONTEXT:ORDINAL] year as a [CONTEXT:UNIT_NAME].
I have been a [CONTEXT:UNIT_NAME] for [CONTEXT:NUMBER] years.
I am a [CONTEXT:UNIT_NAME].  I have been one for [CONTEXT:NUMBER] years.
For almost [CONTEXT:NUMBER] years, I have been a [CONTEXT:UNIT_NAME].
I am a [CONTEXT:UNIT_NAME] with over [CONTEXT:NUMBER] years of experience.
For [CONTEXT:NUMBER] years, I have made my living as a [CONTEXT:UNIT_NAME].
What I do is not important.
I would rather not discuss it.
Is it not obvious?
