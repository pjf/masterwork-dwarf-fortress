      <p>The mod includes many patches done by dfhack, as well as custom plugins. These have gotten so numerous that it warrants its own little readme, because its impossible to memorize all those hotkeys. </p>
      <p><strong>Important: If you Alt+Tab out of the game, for example the access the dfhack console or Dwarf Therapist, Dwarf Fortress thinks that you are still pressing the Alt key. For all intents and purposes it gets stuck. This means all keypresses will be interpreted as Alt+Something, for example Ctrl+C would be Ctrl+Alt+C. To fix this simply press the Alt key once, it will get un-stuck.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Strings:</strong><br>
