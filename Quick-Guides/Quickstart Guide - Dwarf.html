      </p>
<p align="center">Just a few words to get you started. Actually, it got a bit longer. If you are a new player, please take 10 minutes and read it once. It should give you a good idea about the mod. Or, at least about the Dwarf Mode of the mod. </p>
<p><strong>Must-have:</strong> Keep the temperature setting on. It is required for many features.<strong> Dfhack</strong>  is used to fix bugs, add game-mechanics like manually controllable siege-engines, and to enable things that are impossible by modding, like rune-enchanting and poisoning. Please keep it on at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Changes from normal DF</strong>: . Many redundant items have been removed, for example clothing that serves no purpose other then a name. Same for materials, they are standardized, all leather is called leather, not cat/dog/etc leather. There are many more plants, each cavern looks unique, there are about three times as many creatures, twenty or so secret slab types, more vampire and werebeast types... everything is more. But nothing is fundamentally different. MasterworkDF aims to be an addition to DF, not a total conversion. It fixes bugs, adds more game-mechanics, adds utilities and tools for the player to ease playing, and can, optionally, ramp up the difficulty a lot. 30 possible invader-races, inner threats, work accidents... Mind that 90% of the mod is optional, the included settings can toggle almost everything.</p>
<p><strong>World Generation:</strong> MasterworkDF changes to much in the raws, that the normal worldgenerator is not reliable any more. Please use the recommended, advanced worldgenerator. Many templates have been included that are streamlined for the use with MDF.</p>
<p><strong>Utilities:</strong> There is a ton of helpful third-party programs included. Please see the main manual for full info, including separate readmes for every one of the utilities. Dwarf Therapist is probably the most important one.</p>
<p><strong>General info:</strong> Dwarves are a bit stronger and bigger. Trading will be important for special goods you dont have access to otherwise. You have four allies, Humans, Elves, Drow and Gnomes. The Stonecutter Workshop and the Rockforge can ease the start of a fort a lot. Buying an armored dog or mastiff at the start can help secure the fort early. Other then this, just play.</p>
      <p align="center">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> New skills, like runesmithing, writing or praying, are included in the mod. None of them are important at the start, since they are all used for the new workshops. The most important skills are still mason, carpenter, farmer and smiths.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>Only military caste dwarves can enter martial trances, but otherwise nothing has changed. If you want melee, ranged or traps, thats still your choice to make.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> In addition to all vanilla weapons, you can also make throwing weapons. These are good for melee and ranged. You can make powerful great-weapon, only wielded with two hands. A javelin thrower makes a better crossbow, and flint-lock pistols and muskets are the highest achievement of ranged weaponry. </p>
      <p align="left">All weapons can be improved in the weaponry, rune-coated and poisoned.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> Besides vanilla ammo, you can now make broadhead, hammerhead and piercing ammo. These work like slashing damage, blunt damage and piercing damage. Burning or exploding ammo can be made at the chemist.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> Besides vanilla armor, you have access to padded leather armor. This can be worn underneath your metal armor. Any metal armor can also be upgraded to platearmor in the armory and rune-coated at the runesmith.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> In addition to vanilla materials you have access to: refined wood, a difference between tanned skin, scale, chitin and shell, an upgrade system for these animal materials, higher metals like titanium, wolfram, cobalt or chrome, higher alloys like mithril or volcanic. The best is still the delicious blue candy deep underground.</p>
      <p align="left">Other races have defined metals. Elves only mithril, Orcs only rusty steel, Warlocks only bloodsteel, and so forth.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> Many normal human domestic animals have been removed and replaced with more dwarven alternatives. You can have drakes, whose scales make fine armor, mastiffs and shaggy badgerdogs, rock-crabs, leatherwing-bats that can be shorn for leather... special pets include the Ward of Armok, which protects your fort against possessions (read the manual), constructs like golems, landmines and turrets and pets that are needed as reagents in workshops: Sprites, Changelings and Toolkits. These are pastured on the workshop and transformed into your wanted creature, for example a toolkit can be used to build a turret.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> There are some new food, including roasted seeds, cooked eggs, bread, candy, cave-fungus cheese and digable living-rock, which can be butchered. You can also make sausages from meat and vermin remains. Dont ask.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> Alcohol is just as important as ever. But now you can select which drinks to make, have a bigger selection and even two more buildings for it. The brewery has a slightly higher outcome and can make fuel from alcohol, and the Alchemist can brew special plants into potions, drink with magical abilities.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> Mining has not been changed. But some shallow rock types and rubble patches only leave dust when mined, which forces you to dig deeper for real rock. Fossils, relics and treasure can be dug up from ruins, your archeologist can identify and restore them. You can also stumble upon the Gems of Armok, which have special effects tied to them, like blessing the miner, or water, magma and metal generation. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> Your embark selection is pretty much the same as in vanilla. You dont necessarily need an anvil, because you can make them from ore in the smelter, but otherwise everything is the same. Some more pets, some more metals, but nothing that stands out.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> All vanilla nobles are still there. You also have a psychiatrist who calms down tantruming dwarves and an overseer, which is used in succession forts to mark the current player.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Magic: </strong>There is an advanced, very complicated magic system in place. I wont touch the subject here, see the real manual for more info.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Tech:</strong> The more advanced buildings have a multitude of sources. Some require magma, others blueprints or special items traded or stolen from other civs, religious buildings require a step-by-step prodcution of Shrine first, then Altar, then Temple. Others are skill based, for example once your jeweler starts making large gems you get access to the gemforge. The highest tech level is reached from end-game civs. Trade with gnomes, kill frostgiants or automatons for reagents.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Caste System:</strong> Dwarves are members of guilds. Most migrants are just peasants, but you can build a guildhall and join up. Guildmembers learn associated skills twice as fast. The same is true for soldiers. Build a garrison and join a military group, doubling the fitting skill learn rates. You have aggresive legionnaires, protective guards, sniping marksdwarves and fast and agile wrestlers.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Important stuff:</strong> Besides 'Temperature: On', I honestly cant think of anything that needs  to play. Only the metallurgist comes to mind, because all alloy-making reactions have been moved there. Otherwise all vanilla DF rules apply, but there is nothing that MasterworkDF forces you to do to survive. If you play with 'secret fun', you might have some unpleasant visitors in your fort that need the help of the temple/ward of armok to clear out, and 'diseases' needs an apothecary to combat. These are all optional of course...</p>
      <p align="left">Just keep in mind that vanilla DF has <strong>one</strong> invader race, Goblins. MasterworkDF has <strong>ten-fourteen</strong>. This means up a lot  more !FUN!,snatcher, thieves, sieges and ambushes. Again, these are optional. You can even add another <strong>fifteen</strong> fortress defence races to it.</p>
