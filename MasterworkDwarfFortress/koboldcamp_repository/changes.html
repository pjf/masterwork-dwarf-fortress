        </h1>
        <p align="center">Kobolds. Small, dog-like humanoid with long drooping ears. Your race. </p>
        <p align="center">Kobolds are indeed small, only 1/3 the size of a dwarf. This means that all the items looted from your invaders will most likely not benefit you much. It also means that your kobolds are not the greatest of melee fighters. Instead you have to rely on superior numbers (kekeke), ranged weapons and traps.</p>
        <p align="center">The playstyle differs a lot from dwarves: Kobolds dont need alcohol. Kobolds cant dig stone. They can only dig soil. The biggest kobold industries are animal farming, woodstalks and clay.</p>
        <p align="center">Bigger races generally pay no heed to you, unless you have something worth raiding. Only other kobolds will come to trade with your camp or cave. In the end, everyone else is your enemy.</p>
        <p align="center">Kobolds are very happy and should have way fewer tantrum spirals then dwarves. And they have kids. Lots of kids. 1-5 children are born at a time and are fully grown one your later. This means its not important if 1, 2 or 20 die at a time, but it also means that you have a harder time keeping everyone well fed.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Even more important:</strong> Kobolds are bonecarn, they need to eat meat. This means you can no longer support yourself by farming. You have to hunt, fish or breed animals.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="2">Nobles</a>        </h1>
        <p align="center">Kobolds have nobles too. Sort of. Your village chief/head kobold/tribe leader. These are your expedition leader/mayor/king. Traders and hoardcounters take the place of broker and bookkeeper. Warband marshal and leader are the kobold versions of militia commanders and captians. The shaman organizes religion and manager screen, and the witch doctor tends to your wounded. </p>
        <p align="center">And finally, your lasher. He is judge, jury and executioner using his trusty whip.</p>
<hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="4">Food and Drink</a></h1>
      <p align="center">Like mentioned, kobolds dont need alcohol, but do need meat. Here a bit more info:</p>
      <p align="center">Drinking dirty water from a pond or river is bad. If you pump it into a reservior or use a well, it's good. Kobolds will also drink alcohol, which can give them good thoughts if they like the type, but they get negative effects from it. Juices and tea from the juice bar are much prefered.</p>
<p align="center">Food gets a bit more complicated. Even if your foodstock claims to have 500 units of food... if these are plants, your kobolds will starve. You can kill invaders or animals, fish, butcher lifestock or cook vermin remains. You can even use animal traps to catch live vermin to cook those, which gives more meat. </p>
      <p align="center">The fishpond and jack rats are perfect to farm meat.</p>
      <p align="center">If you use the kitchen to make prepared meals, meals need at least one meat-ingredient. Plump helmet + plump helmet + plump helmet + plump helmet is a lavish meal no one will eat.  plump helmet + plump helmet + plump helmet + meat is perfectly fine. Keep this in mind if you dont want to starve.</p>
      <hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="5">Castes</a></h1>
      <p align="center">There are twelve castes in Kobold Camp. Each kobold is member of a caste. They are born under specific star signs and get two abilities. </p>
      <p align="center">You also have two magical castes, the Wiches/Witchers and the Druids. These forsake their sign-bonus for a career in magic. Any spirit-animal and sign-aimed reaction, like the spiritwalking in the sweatlodge, are inaccessable for them.</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Turtle (Water)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Turtle are tough, and tend to  favor shell and bone crafts.  When they must fight they favor a shield.  Like all Water Sign kobolds, they are natural swimmers. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Eel (Water)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Eel are agile, and tend to be fine fishers.  Like all Water Sign kobolds they are natural swimmers. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Dartfrog (Water)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Dartfrog are intrigued by poisons, toxins, and all other forms of brewing.  Like all Water Sign kobolds they are natural swimmers. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Rat (Fire)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Rat are resitant to disease, and tend to favor working with animals.  Like all Fire Sign Kobolds they move a bit more quickly than others. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Salamander (Fire)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Salamander are resitant to fire, and are entranced by the heat of a forge.  Like all Fire Sign Kobolds they move a bit more quickly than others. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Coyote (Fire)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Coyote are creative free spirits and tend to excel at craftswork.  Like all Fire Sign Kobolds they move a bit more quickly than others. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Kestrel (Air) </strong>Kobolds born under the Sign of the Kestrel are natural hunters and bowyers.  Like all Air Sign kobolds, they are adept at stealth and cannot be ensnared in webs. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Owl (Air)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Owl are wise and tend to make good students and teachers alike.  Like all Air Sign kobolds, they are adept at stealth and cannot be ensnared in webs. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Bluebird (Air)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Bluebird are at peace with wild creatures and tend to find work in medicine.  Like all Air Sign kobolds, they are adept at stealth and cannot be ensnared in webs. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Viper (Earth)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Viper are not shy about close combat with knife nor fang.  Like all Earth Sign kobolds, they begin to thrive upon combat once they get a taste of it. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Lizard (Earth)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Lizard have great powers of recuperation.  Like all Earth Sign kobolds, they begin to thrive upon combat once they get a taste of it. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Badger (Earth)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Badger are strong and ferocious, and tend to find work as butchers.  Like all Earth Sign kobolds, they begin to thrive upon combat once they get a taste of it.</p>
      <hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="6">Clay</a></h1>
      <p align="center">Clay is not often used by dwarves. Kobolds on the other hand use it as their main source of rock. Due to unexplainable quantum mechanics, one tile of clay can be the source of unlimited clay boulders. You can make walls and huts, workshops and furnaces, even furniture and tools from clay. </p>
      <p align="center">Constructions, like walls and floors, can be made from normal, sundried clay, while furniture and items must be burned in the clay oven first.</p>
<hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="7" id="7">No Digging</a></h1>
      <p align="center">Kobolds cant dig, at least until you manage to steal a pick, either from the dwarves or the drow. You have a 10% chance each time you steal from them. This is your only chance to start mining yourself. Prepare for an early aboveground fort.</p>
      <hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="8" id="72">Poisons</a></h1>
      <p align="center">Poisons play a big role in kobold society. The earliest squads should use blowguns with poisoned darts, and later tech allows you to poison traps and weapons as well. Being naturally bad melee fighters, be sure to rely on this little extra in fights.</p>
      <p align="center">You need kobold bulb for the first, and plants+oil+tallow for the second. Later in the game you can mix much more powerful poisons in a workshop tech stolen from the deep drow.</p>
      <hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="9" id="722">Alcohol</a></h1>
      <p align="center">Unlike dwarves, kobolds cannot drink all day without feeling an ill effect. Alcoholic drinks give a reduction to speed, possible dizziness and nausea, but also make your bold fearless. This effect is temporary, but you should better stick to juices, tea or water for your camp.</p>
      <p align="center">This means alcohol as drink source should be a last resort only. </p>
      <hr />
      <h1 align="center"><a name="10" id="7222">Materials</a></h1>
      <p align="center">Usually players build most things of stone and metal. Both materials are rare when playing Kobold Camp. Your primary buildmats are leather and wood. Dyes, bones and skulls are also quite important, but a good tanning industry is a must for a successful camp.</p>
      <p align="center">Warpaints, tattoos, scrolls and ceremonial totems all use dyes to be made, and your early trap-parts are based on wood and bones.</p>
      <p align="center">Gems should be preserved for the more ritualistic reactions of the magic tech tree.</p>
