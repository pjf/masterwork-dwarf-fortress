    <tr>
      <td width="665"><p align="center">The mod includes several pre-set embark profiles. This allows  a quick start and should help figuring out the different game mechanics.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">The Ogre</p>
        <p align="center">Your Kobolds have only a few skills and you have next to no items with you. An axe, some meat and some woodstalk seeds. Thats it. Trustworthy pets only include 1 shalswar to hunt vermin and 3 jack rats.... but... your starting seven do have company. A mighty ogre protects your camp.        </p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">The Rat Shepard</p>
        <p align="center">You have some standard gear, axe, food and seeds... and a strange guy with a harmonica. He brought his pets, 25 jack rats. Thats at least 100 jack rats after a year. And about 400 after two years. If you survive that long you will be swimming in meat. You also have cave beetles for chitin, shalswars to hunt vermin and dogs. Someone has to shepard the rat herd.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">The Brave Bold</p>
        <p align="center">A bloodsteel machete. A legendary item handed down from generation to generation. It will be the best weapon your kobolds will ever see. Your kobold hero with skills in swordfight and dodging should use it well. Besides your priceless artefact you have standard gear with you, meat, seeds, an axe.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Hunting Party</p>
        <p align="center">1 axe, 5 slings. Everyone is armed. Its not much, but at least you can start capturing the caves early. Recommended if you start on a cave and want to settle the first cavern. You have 50 shots and 30 units of leather for armor and quiver. Good luck.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Traps, Webs and Doom        </p>
        <p align="center">Your mechanics and carpenters carry a small supply of rusty iron bars and coal. Besides your axe, your best weapon is defense. 4 trap spiders acompany you and are ready to web your traps. Wall yourself in with your meat, drink and rats.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Hypno Toad</p>
        <p align="center">A relatively normal embark, food, drink, seeds, axe. Shalswars to hunt, jack rats to be eaten... and a lot of wood to build a quick fort. Your kobold tribe has been entrusted with a psychoactive toad. Guard it well. And lick it. I dare you. I double dare you.</p>
