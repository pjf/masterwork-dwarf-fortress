          <p>Kobolds can buy several pets that are universal, but two especially stand out: The Kea and the Honey Badger. Both are strong signs for thievery and bravery in fearless battle with a bigger foe, and therefore highly regarded by kobold society.          </p>
          <p>You have 5 special Kobold pets in this mod. Trap spiders are used to farm silk and make better, webbed traps. Jack Rats are your main food source, be sure to always take some at embark. Ogres are you main melee unit, Shalswars hunt vermin and the toads... they can be licked. Lick the toad. Do it. Now. Side effects wary.</p>

        <p align="center">Ogres are your best friends. 300 times the size of a Kobold, Ogres are your main melee unit. You can train them for war, equip them with weapons and armor. They are a bit dumb, maybe even slow sometimes, so have some patience with them.</p>
        <p align="center">Ogres can be brought at embark. Otherwise you have to ask your Kobold caravans to bring some with them. You can upgrade them at the Ogre Cave. </p>
        <p align="center">If you equip them with a tree trunk they will get an Area of Effect attack, stunning all enemies in range. Ogres with this upgrade blink with a skull icon, to show how deadly they are.</p>
        <p align="center">You can also armor an Ogre. For this you need a full set of armor.Torso, legs and feet. These can be made of ironbone, lamellar leather, rigid scale, shell or chitin. Simply station all Ogres you want to equip in the Ogre Cave, next to the bed. Use zone:pasture for this. A Kobold can now run the reaction and when successful you will see the golden mist, like on the screenshot below. The Ogre will then transform into a fully healed and armored Ogre.</p>
