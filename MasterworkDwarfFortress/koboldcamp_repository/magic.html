              <p align="center">Witchers are the ranged mages your kobolds can employ. They are good supporters and have 2 initial abilities. To use mages correctly, you dont have to do anything, really. You can just assign them normal military duty and they will use their abilities as soon as they see a valid target.</p>
              <p align="center">Witches are female and can throw shadow-webs and entangle a single unit in roots.</p>
              <p align="center">Witchers are male and can curse enemies with sickness and slow them down.</p>
              <p align="center">Both castes can learn an additional 15 spells each. A hide spell, a haste spell and a blood-spike ranged attack you can pay for yourself. The other 12 are learned from mojos you have to steal from orcs or frost giants.</p>
              <p align="center">To become a witcher you need a witchers hut.</p></td>

        <h1 align="center"><a name="2" id="2">Druids</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Druids are the kobold melee mages. Once they reach the enemy they transform into a giant spirit bear. Twice the size of a normal grizzly and covered in a protective, steel-grade aura, they are good fighters. They will stay in bear-form for 1 week, followed by 1 week of dizziness and slowness. Once they are back to normal, they can transform again. This means you can employ them in battle about every 2 weeks.</p>
        <p align="center">Keep in mind that they will drop all equipment when they transform, so you dont have to assign good gear to them. Probably some armorparts and a shield, but thats it. </p>
        <p align="center">To become a druid you need a druids hut and half a year of time for meditation. Meditating kobolds dont do any work and are rather easy targets, so make sure to guard them well.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="3" id="3">Warpaint</a></h1>
        <p align="center">You can paint armors in the warpainters studio.</p>
        <p align="center">Kobold warpaint has special effects on the wearer and can cover any leather-made armor. You can chose between seven different abilities, and you can stack different ones on the same armor, but not the same effect twice. This means &quot;10% speed + no stun&quot; is ok, but &quot;10% speed + 10% speed&quot; wont work.</p>
        <p align="center">Dyes are produced, like always, from plants. The only exception is carmine dye, which is made from the hive-able cochineal insect.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="4" id="4">Tattoo</a></h1>
        <p align="center">You can tattoo a kobold with henna in a tattoo parlor. You first need to steal the building plans from the humans.</p>
        <p align="center">Being tattooed with a tribal henna tattoo is a great honor for a kobold. The boost in confidence and the frightening look of them helps them work and fight better. Each tattooed kobold will gain a  30% bonus on strength, toughness, endurance and recuperation.</p>
        <p align="center">Each kobold will show '(tattooed)' behind his name.</p>
        <p align="center">Henna tattoos fade after a while, the effect lasts for  about 1 year.<br />

<hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="5" id="5">Hex</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Hexes are magical objects producted in the hexers hut. They require a stack of bones to be thrown in prophesy, and the results might be a magical hex. Then again, it might only be a pile of bones. You should get about one hex every second try. </p>
        <p align="center">You can enchant weapon with sickness, slow and madness effects, and grow your keas and badgers to giant monsters, or give them the gift of intelligence with a hex. You can even stack the hexes on a weapon, or combine them with a poison of your choice.</p>
        <p align="center">Hexes are officially tools and are stockpiled as such.</p>
<hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="6" id="6">Curses</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Curses are spoken in the voodoo totem. Its building plans must be stolen from the warlocks first, and all curses need unholy relics either stolen, or taken from the dead cold hands of warlocks. </p>
        <p align="center">You have three kinds of curses. The first one raises most to all of the dead on the map as undead zombies that attack the living. Depending on your point of view, that can be good or bad.</p>
        <p align="center">You can also curse an entire race. Every member of that race will suddenly feel his blood boil, and he will sweat liquid magma, burning himself alive and setting the world on fire. One singular curse can wipe out an entire army. Keep in mind the magma causes friendly fire as well, will destroy their gear, and anything of yours that is nearby.</p>
        <p align="center">The last curse is a self-destruct option, you will curse your own tribe with it. </p>
        <p align="center">You will need 10 unholy relics for each curse. They count as tools and stockpiled as such.</p>
        <p align="center">Using curses will have negative effects on your kobolds, the morale will sink and all negative thoughts will be intensified. While this is normally no problem for one or two curses, you will notice increasing tantruming and madness if you curse too many enemies.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="7" id="7">Ceremonies/Dances</a>        </h1>
        <p align="center">Ceremonies and Raindances are the positive version of curses. Using simple ingredients and a gemstone, you can alter the weather and help nature to grow back natural resources like grass and trees.</p>
        <p align="center">To gain access to the ceremonial grounds, you first need to steal the building plan from the orcs.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="8" id="8">Spiritwalking</a></h1>
        <p align="center">All kobolds are born under an animal sign. They can  access the powers of these guardians, by taking on abilities of their sign for example. For more information on this, please see &quot;General Changes:Castes&quot;. </p>
        <p align="center">Kobolds that have a sign can sometimes spiritwalk them their animals as guide. Currently this is possible by meditating in the sweatlodge and will result in a fully healed kobold. Even lost limbs, broken spines and nerve damage can be healed in such a way.</p>
        <p align="center">Because witchers and druids abandoned their birth signs and are drawn to different sorts of magic, they cannot spiritwalk.</p>
