Because of this, if a logic gate is connected to a gear assembly that is connected to one of the logic gate's own input machines, a feedback loop may result that causes the gear assembly to switch on and off every frame, which can kill your framerate.  So, avoid this.  <br>Slowdown can also occur if a power source (generally a water wheel whose artificial water source is starting to dry up) is switching on and off rapidly, especially if you have many machines operating.  Using natural rivers or steam engines/clockwork keys as your main power source is the best option.</div></td>

If the game seems to freeze but isn't actually crashing, press the space button so that it pauses the moment it unfreezes.  If you have a bunch of animals together in a pasture, remove them from the pasture and then unpause (if you do not, it will probably happen again in a few seconds).  This seems to be a DF pathing bug, rather than a direct effect of the script, so it is unlikely that I can fix it without simply removing the option of getting animals to cluster together altogether.  In general, try and avoid stuffing too many animals into one small area, or make sure to 'dismiss' them from following each other before you do.</div></td>
