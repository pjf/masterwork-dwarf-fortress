Because of this, if a logic gate is connected to a gear assembly that is connected to one of the logic gate's own input machines, a feedback loop may result that causes the gear assembly to switch on and off every frame, which can kill your framerate.  So, avoid this.  <br>Slowdown can also occur if a power source (generally a water wheel whose artificial water source is starting to dry up) is switching on and off rapidly, especially if you have many machines operating.  Using natural rivers or steam engines/clockwork keys as your main power source is the best option.</div></td>
