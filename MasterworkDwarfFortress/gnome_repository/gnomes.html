        <p>Settle down, everyone!  Gnomes in the front, please remove your hats.  You, turn off that lamp.  You, with the cuckoo clock on your head, please shut it off or set it to silent.  And somebody, please get that grizzly out of here, we'll be dealing with some very touchy subjects and I don't want anything broken.</p>
		<p>All right, is everyone here?  Good, listen up.</p>
		<p>Now, as you are no doubt all aware, the kingdoms of the Big Folk are on the rise.  Even as we speak, their scouts are spreading across the surface of the world, searching out locations for new outposts, and no matter how well we may try to conceal ourselves, they will no doubt blunder across our kingdoms sooner or later.  It has therefore been decided, by orders of the Gnome King, that our best hope for survival is to send scouts of our own (that's you!) into the world to seek out and secure land untouched by the clumsy hands of the Big Folk, and - if possible - to foster alliances with the better of them.</p>
		<p>Now - Pipe down, all of you, I know you all find it offensive, but it is - I SAID QUIET!  Thank you.  As I was saying, I know you may find it offensive to collaberate with the primitive races, but it cannot be denied that in order to survive the coming years, securing alliances with at least some of the Big Folk will be essential.  We have already sent letters of apology to the dwarves - it seems that some of our exiled criminals have gone feral and taken to raiding dwarven settlements and stealing their alchohol - and they seem to have accepted our offer for the time being.  As creatures of the earth and lovers of craft and wealth, they no doubt feel a kind of kindred toward our race, and so it is in our best interest to milk that sense of kindred for all it's worth.  The elves should also be willing allies, as they, like us, are friends of nature.  Humans, too - QUIET! - Humans will also be useful allies, if we can secure their cooperation.  They enjoy novel weapons and will no doubt find it worthwhile to trade with us.</p>
		<p>An alliance with our ancient enemy, the goblins, has, of course, been deemed impossible, and as a result, the orcs have declared eternal war against us as well.  There are numerous other foes roaming the world as well, some of which you may have heard of, some of which you have not.  Fortunately, since we have been studying and innovating while they have been bashing each other's skulls in with hammers and poking holes in each other with pointy sticks, our technology far outstrips theirs.  Used properly, you should have no difficulty fending off the jealous hordes.  The remainder of this meeting will be dedicated to explaining, in brief, the technology you will have available and how best to use your natural gnomish talents to survive in the wide, open world.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc" id="cc">Castes</a></h1>
        <p>It is part of our proud gnomish tradition to begin studying a craft early in life.  Nearly all gnome children are born with an innate talent for one craft or another, and they are innately drawn toward working in that craft almost as soon as they learn to walk*.  This kind of behavior should be encouraged.  Many of our kind achieve legendary skills in their selected craft by the time they reach adulthood, which frees up the adults to do more specific tasks.</p>
		<p>There are, however, certain gnomes that lack any talent in the arts, preferring to drown themselves in booze and fight with everything that moves.  In the past, these talentless psychopaths were among the typical criminal element, but in the coming years their natural aggression may prove useful if drafted as soldiers.  If nothing else, at least they'll be likely to get themselves killed before they start throwing tantrums.</p>

		<p>*Be sure to enable [SET_LABOR_LISTS:SKILLS] in the data/init/d_init.txt file to take advantage of this.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="dd" id="dd">Animals</a></h1>
        <p>The journey will be difficult and our enemies will be many, but let us not forget that there is one ally we will find wherever we go.  I am talking, of course, about our animal friends - both those we bring with us, and those we meet in the wild along the way.  Our kind has a strong connection with the creatures of the wild - so strong, that just being around us seems makes them smarter.  Our furry, feathered, and scaly allies will learn from experience and grow more powerful as they engage the enemy in combat.</p>
		<p>While other races need to trap creatures in cages and bribe them with food in order to earn their companionship, animals will join our cause when we call to them.  If we treat them well and release them when we are through, we will find it much easier to acquire allies.  Our armies await us around the world.  Remember this - we are not alone.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="ee" id="ee">Gadgets</a></h1>
        <p>Of course, in order to foster a relationship with the Big Folk and send the troublemakers packing, we're going to need more than just the helping paws of our forest friends.  We're going to need good old gnomish ingenuity if we're going to make a name for ourselves.  We're sending you off with the blueprints for some of the finest technology that gnomekind has to offer - clockwork armor, rocket boots, high-tech weapons that will make our enemies cower in their boots, the works.  Take a look at these gadgets!  A helmet with mechanical hands!  Spring-loaded swords!  Power drills!  Glue guns!  A head-mounted cuckoo clock!  Admittedly, some will be more useful than others.  But I'm sure you'll find some use for them.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="ff" id="ff">Automatons</a></h1>
        <p>Among our finest pieces of technology are the automatons.  When the going gets tough and traps aren't enough, build some clockwork robots to do the dirty work for you.  There's a fine selection of models and materials you'll be able to make use of, from tiny clockwork beetles and mice to enormous mechanical elephants and dragons.  The larger automatons will, of course, take a lot of time and resources to build, but they will be a great asset when stronger foes show up.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="gg" id="gg">Clockborgs</a></h1>
        <p>Now, with any luck, you'll manage to keep yourselves from losing limbs, but accidents can and do happen.  Fortunately, we're sending you off with the blueprints for one of the finest inventions known to gnomish medicine: the Conversion Chamber.  It's a completely autonomous device that will replace all of a gnome's limbs with clockwork prosthetics.  Or, if you're really looking to make a full conversion, it can even replace your skin with a metal exoskeleton.  The procedure, as I've been told, is completely safe, or at least as safe as anything else you'll be facing out there!</p>
		<p>Well, that's all I've got for now.  Further details concerning your available technology and abilities can be found in the pamphlets given out at the door, be sure to take one and have a good look at it.  I don't want to hear anyone whining about how they starved or stopped getting migrants because they didn't realize that they would have to contact the homeland to invite caravans in.  Speaking of which, you'll have to contact the homeland by telegraph if you want to trade.  We expect to hear back within the year - if you can't scrape enough resources together to build a simple seismic telegraph by that time, we'll assume you're all dead and we'll stop sending migrants, too.  We can't afford to send out our valuable goods and workers into the dangerous world without a very good reason, you got that?</p>
		<p>Good luck, and may the light of inspiration shine upon you for the good of all gnomekind.</p>
