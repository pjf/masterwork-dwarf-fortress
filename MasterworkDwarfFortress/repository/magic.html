        <h1 align="center"><a name="aa" id="aa">Magical Buildings</a></h1>
        <p align="center"><strong>tl;dr: High-tech buildings that transform dwarves into glorious bastards of inhuman power. Takes one year till max lvl. Takes a lot of reagents.</strong></p>
        <p align="center">Four buildings are used for the magic system. The School of Wizardry is needed to make special ingredients and to join the mages, e.g. become an arcane dwarf. You might also get  arcane dwarves as well as mages as migrants, but this is rare. Arcane dwarves have a higher skill learn rate for the  sorcerer skill and the magic weapon user skill.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>School of Wizardry</strong></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/buildings/Mages Guild.png" width="186" height="182" alt="Arena" /></p>
        <p align="center">This is the first workshop you will have to build. In it you create the basic reagents of magic.        </p>
        <p align="center"><strong>10 platinum bars =&gt; Catalyst Rod</strong> (used for spell staves)</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>1 orichalcum bar =&gt; Phylactery</strong> (used for mage transformation)</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>10 paper/vellum/papyrus + 1 ink =&gt; spell tome</strong>        (used for auras)</p>
        <p align="center">Taking all these reagents will create one arcane dwarf. He will get the ability to conceal himself is fleeing, and will be a valid target for all magic types. Training one dwarf will take three months. In this time he will stay in the workshop, wont need food, water or sleep, and wont do other jobs. For all intents and purposes, he is not part of your fort anymore. After three full months he will transform into the arcane dwarf-civ member and be under your control again.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Altars of Magic</strong></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/buildings/altar of black magic.png" width="120" height="119" alt="Arena" /><img src="icons/buildings/altar of elemental magic.png" width="121" height="119" alt="Arena" /><img src="icons/buildings/altar of white magic.png" width="119" height="118" alt="Arena" /></p>
        <p align="center">These three buildings allow the training of real mages. Elemental, black or white mages. Black and White Altars require glumprong or feather wood, which only grows in good or evil biomes.</p>
<p align="center">You can join the magical schools of fire, air, water or earth in the elemental altar, three different types of black magic in the black altar and three different types of white magic in the white altar. You will need some basic reagents for this that fit the schools theme. Each transformation takes three months, in which the dwarves will stay inside the workshop, wont eat, drink or sleep, and wont take any commands. That means training a normal dwarf into a lvl3 mage takes at least one full year. </p>

        <h1 align="center"><a name="bb" id="bb">Staves and Auras</a></h1>
        <p align="center"><strong>tl;dr: A staff is a ranged weapon, magic missiles the ammo.</strong></p>
        <p align="center"><strong> Fire staff + Fire mage = Extra spell.</strong></p>
        <p align="center">Mages can use magic staves. These are made in all the buildings with a catalyst rod and a piece of wood. Some basic fitting reagents might be needed as well, see above.</p>
        <p align="center">Staves are a ranged weapon that can be wielded like any other weapon. It needs ammo and a quiver to work. Staff ammo, called magic missile, can be made in the Mages Guild. You only need a arcane spell tome, which is preserved, and one steel bar for 25 magic missiles. Staves use the arcane weapon user skill, normal dwarves learn this very, very slowly. All magical dwarves learn it at twice the normal rate. This determines how will you hit with magic missiles.</p>
        <p align="center">Each school of magic has its own staff. They will still fire magic missiles, but if a fire-school mage uses a fire-staff, he will get an additional spell. The same is true for a water-school mage using a water-staff, or a lich using a black staff. Wait, did I just say Lich? Yes, you can have liches now. :) The higher the mage in his school, the better the additional spell gets.  Mages will automatically use these as soon as the staff is equipped, even if they run out of ammo/magic missiles.</p>
        <p align="center">Equipping those work just like crossbows and bolts. Even normal dwarves can use them, but are really bad at it and wont get the extra spells. You can also equip your mages with swords or hammers, but again, they wont get any extra spells.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>(Neutral) Magic Staff</strong> =&gt; Steelgrade magic missile</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Fire Staff </strong>=&gt;  Steelgrade magic missile + Dragonfire bolts. Higher levels shoot dragonfire bolts faster. Should instantly kill most things, start fires and melt down the equipment.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Water Staff</strong> =&gt;  Steelgrade magic missile + Icebolt. Higher levels get a higher range and are allowed more targets, up to three simultaniously. Spawns ocean waves on impact.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Air Staff</strong> =&gt;  Steelgrade magic missile + Web bolts. Higher levels shoot web bolts faster. Spawns webs on impact.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Earth Staff</strong> =&gt;  Steelgrade magic missile + Short range rockbolts spawning dust clouds. Higher levels are allowed more targets, up to three simultaniously.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Black Staff</strong> =&gt;  Steelgrade magic missile + Cursed Bolts, causing a cloud of sickness to spawn on impact.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>White Staff</strong> =&gt;  Steelgrade magic missile + Sleeping Bolts, causing a cloud of sleeping powder to spawn on impact.</p>
        <h1 align="center">Auras</h1>
        <p align="center">Auras work just like staves, but instead of being weapons, they are shields. To make them you need a steel bar and a spell tome, which is preserved. White/Black auras also need evil/good wood.</p>
        <p align="center">They have a 25% block chance and add an additional spell to each mage. The aura will damage any enemy that is 1 tile away, it is very close combat oriented.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Fire Aura</strong> =&gt; Causes pain and blisters</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Air Aura</strong> =&gt; Causes dizzyness and nausea</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Earth Aura</strong> =&gt; Causes paralyzis</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Water Aura</strong> =&gt; Causes slow down</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Black Aura</strong> =&gt; Causes bleeding and necrosis</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>White Aura</strong> =&gt; Kills undeads</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc" id="cc">How do I use mages?</a></h1>
        <p align="center"><strong>tl;dr: They use their spells automatically.</strong></p>
        <p align="center">Mages can be assigned uniforms and weapons like normal military, they will do labor and run errands, eat and drink and sleep like any regular fort member. The only difference is their access to interactions. When surprised as a civilian or heavily injured as a soldier and forced to flee, they will try to hide themselves using magic. </p>
        <p align="center">When they see an enemy in range they will use their spells automatically. The same is true for friendly spells and buffs for your allies, the mages dont need any additional player input, they just do them.</p>
        <p align="center">It would be wise to use fire or water mages without any other dwarves nearby, because of the high risk of fires and frostbite. </p>
        <p align="center">Fire and Air are ranged fighters, Water semi-ranged/melee, Earth is pure melee. Black offers vampires for melee, demonbound for melee and liches as support. White has cleric healers as support, witch hunters specialised against undeads and vampires, and the arcane defender, melee support. It would be best to put him into the fray of the battle, his auras will protect those around him.</p>
        <p align="center">How you will use mages in the end is of course completely up to you. An army of fire-mages will destroy everything, but also melt down valuable gear, start fires and might kill friendlies. A vampire in you army might be great as a fighter, but the price to pay is high. A lich can summon an entire undead army, but what if they decide that they dont need you any more and turn against the fort?</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Tip: Give mages custom profession names or nicknames.</strong></p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="dd" id="dd">Familiars</a></h1>
        <p align="center"><strong>tl;dr: Mages lvl2/lvl3 transform one changeling into a special pet.</strong> <strong>Wartrain and assign them to the mage.</strong></p>
        <p align="center">Each magic school has a familiar, a special magical pet that can buff your mages. Each mage from lvl2 on can create one from any nearby changeling, and each of the black and white mages have a unique familiar with them. </p>
        <p align="center">These pets should be war-trained and assigned as work animals to the fitting mage. As long as they stay within a few tiles from the mage, he will get access to a magical buff. The familiars themselves are also no weaklings, they can either fight well or have magic abilities of their own. </p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Fire</strong> =&gt; Fire Sprite, can throw fireballs and spray jets of fire.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Air</strong> =&gt; Griffon, flying, can shriek to paralyze enemies nearby.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Water</strong> =&gt; Blizzard Elemental, can throw iceshards and jets of freezing water.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Earth</strong> =&gt; Basilisk, good melee fighter, can petrify targets.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Black (Vampire Mage)</strong> =&gt; Black Marble Gargoyle, stoneskin, good melee fighter.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Black (Demonbound)</strong> =&gt; Hulking Black Barghest, very fast, good melee fighter.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Black (Lich)</strong>  =&gt; Gargantuan Bone Golem,  good melee fighter. Can resurrect minions.</p>
        <p align="center">(the white familiars are unfinished as of yet and miss the interactions)</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>White (Cleric Healer)</strong> =&gt; White Unicorn Stallion, can heal nearby dwarves.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>White (Witch Hunter)</strong> =&gt; White Sabretiger, does extra damage against evil creatures.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>White (Arcane Protector)</strong> =&gt; Giant Albino Mastiff, buffs toughness and endurance of all nearby dwarves.        </p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="sss" id="sss">Upgrade System</a></h1>
        <p align="center"><strong>tl;dr: Upgrade step-by-step, get more powerful each time. Black/White has no upgrades, instead you can only have one of each type at the same time.</strong></p>
        <p align="center">Level 0: Each elemental school of magic has several levels. You start with the basic arcane dwarf, one spell: Hide. </p>
        <p align="center">Level 1: He can be transformed into a elemental-kin: Ashkin, Wavekin, Windkin, Earthkin. They keep their hide spell, possess one special ability, one basic spell and get an extra spell from fitting staves and one spell from auras. And thats it. </p>
        <p align="center">Level 2: Any kin can transform into the second level of magic, the elemental-mancer. Flamemancer, Watermancer, Airmancer, Stonemancer. They can do everything the kins can do, plus a new spell, a more powerful spell from staves, in most cases another special ability, and the ability to create one familiar.</p>
        <p align="center">Level 3: Any mancer can be transformed again to master his school of magic. They will keep all their old abilities, plus a new special ability, a new spell, an even more powerful bonus from the staves, create a second familiar.</p>
        <p align="center">You can create as many mages as you like. Mind that Magic schools are mutually exclusive. A firemancer cannot become a wavekin, or a earthkin cannot become a icemage. Choose well.</p>
        <p align="center">White and Black magic does not have an upgrade system. Instead you have three options, with a very powerful mage directly at your disposal. Meddling with black magic can be dangerous, and the mages can turn against you... white magic is not used for combat, but only plays a supporting role for your military or fortress. You can only create one of each type, you cannot have 4 liches or 10 arcane protectors. Once your unique mage dies, you can try creating a new one. The magical residue will linger for about one month, then you can start making another lich, vampire, demonbound, cleric healer, witch hunter or arcane protector. </p>
