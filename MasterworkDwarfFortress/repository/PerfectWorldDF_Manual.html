<p>PerfectWorldDF
is a graphical world designing tool for the
fantasy game Dwarf Fortress made by Bay 12 Games. It allows you to
modify your
world_gen.txt file in a way that gives you a great deal of control of
how
worlds are generated. Normally, in order to generate an acceptable
fantasy
world, Dwarf Fortress generates maps randomly and rejects maps that
don&rsquo;t
fulfill certain criteria specified in the world_gen.txt file. Using
PerfectWorldDF,
you can directly control much of this process and decide for yourself
if this
is the world you want to play with. </p>
<p>Any of
you who frequent Civfanatics.com might have seen my
<a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=310891">map
scripts</a> for Civilization IV, Civilization IV: Colonization and some
of the
various mods like Fall from Heaven 2. I had a lot of technology sitting
around,
and as a huge Dwarf Fortress fan I decided to put some of it to use
here as an
expression of my fandom. The world_gen.txt file thankfully exposes
direct map
data that can be manipulated by an external map generator, and this
allows a
great deal of flexibility for map generation. Once you have something
in PW
that you like, you can export the map to the world_gen.txt file, start
up Dwarf
Fortress and watch your world come to life! Personally, I have had a
lot of fun
just generating maps and reading the legends and watching empires rise
and fall
during the world gen process. It&rsquo;s another way to enjoy Dwarf
Fortress.</p>
<p>So
anyway, as much as I wanted this utility to be very
simple and easy to use, it kinda grew into something that needed a
manual, and
that is the purpose of this document. We&rsquo;ll start with a
table of
contents.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;">Note</span>:
This is a Windows Forms
application and as such requires the Microsoft .NET framework version
3.5 to be installed
on the machine. Sorry Linux and Mac users! I have no idea if this can
be run on
those platforms or how to do that.</p>
