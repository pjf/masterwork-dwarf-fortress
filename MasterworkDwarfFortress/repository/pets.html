      <td width="665"><p>General info on pets in MasterworkDF: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All creatures can be milked twice as often as in vanilla.        </li>
          <li>All poisonous/venomous creatures can be milked for their poison/venom.</li>
          <li>Many creatures give fleece when sheared,  giving 3 units of cloth after spinning.</li>
          <li>Many creatures give pelts when butchered, giving furs after tanning.</li>
          <li>All animals give leather relative of their size. A cat gives 1, a oxen gives 7.</li>
          <li>All animals lay way, way less eggs.</li>
          <li>Grazing animals can be kept indoors and fed, using the Stables.</li>
          <li>Many animals can learn skills (biting, dodging, fighter) in the Warbeast Kennels.</li>
          <li>Many animals can be armored in Iron or Steel in the Warbeast Kennels.</li>
          <li>Changelings are a base-creature for transformations, always have some around.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All in all animal farming makes a lot more sense if is far more powerful than in vanilla DF, but the amount of eggs has been nerfed a lot. You can create many more items and very powerful war-beasts, but less food this way.</p>
<p>This is a list of all domestic pets you can buy at embark. Prices are the embark points needed, the caravan prices depend on demand and broker skill. Your civilization might have access to additional pets, which are dependant on the biome it lives in. </p>
<p>Kobolds and Orcs have their own special pets, more info about these can be found in their respective manuals.</p>
<hr />

Can you keep these mushrooms under control, or will you succumb to the Overgrowth?</em></p>

        This ward has the power to unveil the cultmaster of the carp god. Be sure that you want to do this before you use it. A nuisance while hidden, he is rather docile. But if you threaten or corner him, you will have a real fight on your hands. You are warned. Station this ward near the dwarf you suspect and wait for the reaction. It can also cure possessed dwarves that act strangely.</p>
        <p><em>Special: Affects nearby dwarves with an interaction. If the dwarf is possessed, will be cured. If the dwarf is a cult-member, will be unveiled, which turns them hostile. </em></p>

      <p align="center"><img src="screenshots/phms.png" alt="" width="755" height="63" /></p>
<p align="center">
<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br />
  - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
<p><br />
  - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
<p><br />
  - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br />
  - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br />
  - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br />
  - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br />
  - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p></div>
