<h1>Editing Maps with the Brush.</h1>
It is possible to edit the different map types directly using the
brush. This is something I really wanted to include into this
application, but many of the ideas that I had regarding how this should
be done didn't work very well. You should be able to do whatever you
might want to do, but it's not as easy or intuitive as I would have
liked it to be. I will try to use this section to explain some of the
issues you might face while using the brush.<br>
<h3>What the brush is useful for.</h3>
The brush is most useful for making small edits to maps that you have
made with the generation functions. If you want to connect two oceans
by a channel, or extend a mountain range, or create a mysterious forest
in the middle of a desert, you can do that easily.<br>
<br>
However, if you want to paint the entire map from scratch, you might
find the system clunky, confusing and altogether way too much work.
First I will explain some of the basic brush functions and the options
they have and how they work, and then I will explain some of the
confusion that comes with relying only on the brush. <br>
<h3>Options for the brush.</h3>

<br>
The 'Brush Value' control determines the value that is painted with the
brush. If you are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> using a
'Smoothing Brush' as indicated by the check box, then the whole brush
will use the value set by the control. If you are using a smoothing
brush, then the brush value selected will be weighted by 100% at the
center of the brush, and 0% at the edge of the brush along a cosine
curve. When the brush weight is 100% it paints the value of the brush,
when the weight is 0% it leaves the underlying values unchanged.
Everything in between will be a smooth blend between your current brush
value and the values that existed before. To demonstrate this curve
better look at the following graph. For a brush of radius 8, this graph
represents the weight of the brush as the distance from the center
increases:<br>

<br>
The brush size options are Point, Small, and Large. The reason that you
don't have direct access to the brushes radius, is because I wanted the
cursor to represent the extent of the brushes effect, and I couldn't do
that at every zoom level with a Windows cursor, for complicated reasons
that I won't go into. In any case, the actual size of the brush also
depends upon the zoom level of the map you are painting on. The higher
the zoom, the smaller the brush in terms of tile radius. For the small
and large brush sizes, the extent of the brushes effect is what you see
on the screen no matter the zoom level. The point size brush is a
single map tile no matter what the zoom level, and is weighted 100% on
a smoothing brush or a flat brush.<br>
<h3>Painting a map on a blank canvas.</h3>
This is where the painting work flow falls a bit short. One problem is
that the final map that combines all the different map inputs is
normalized to values between 0.0 and 1.0. The lowest value on the map
is always 0.0 and the highest value is always 1.0 and everything else
is scaled to be between them. As soon as you start painting on a blank
map with a value of 0.5, as soon as you release the mouse button all
the values you painted will jump to 1.0 as the highest values on the
map. Internally however, the edit value in memory is still 0.5, so if
you then raise the brush value to 0.75 and paint with it, those values
will become 1.0 and the painting you did earlier will fall down to 0.66
or so.<br>
<br>
One way to mitigate this confusion somewhat is to decide where you want
your highest mountain and paint a 1.0 there. That will stabilize the
brush values from there on out to make things more predictable, but
there is another item of confusion you will run into. Painting by hand
tends to lead to much of the map having 3 or 4 discrete values, rather
than the full spectrum of highs to lows. This wreaks havoc with the
threshold sliders. The sliders used to adjust the different thresholds
respond to your brush painting to try to maintain an accurate
percentage and they will jump around, wildly changing the colors on the
map as you paint. It takes considerable mental discipline to paint when
colors you are using change with every stroke.<br>
<br>
These reasons are why it is easier to edit an existing map than to
paint a new one from scratch.
<h3>How the system works.</h3>
Edits are not stored on a map in the way other map data stored. There
is no two-dimensional array for the storage of editing data. Each time
you press and release the left mouse button over a map an 'edit'
&nbsp;containing a list of all the map tiles altered and how they are
altered is pushed onto an undo stack. There is no specific limit to the
levels of undo. You can undo all of your edits at any time, even after
a save and reload. When the final map is built from the input of the
various noise maps etc. the edits are then added to it from the bottom
of the undo stack.
