You will get those either at embark, by trade, or from the timberyard. All the refining reactions in the timberyard have a change to leave seeds. You can farm following trees:</p></td>

        <h1 align="center"><a name="2" id="2">Archeology</a></h1>
        <p align="center">You can find fossils while mining. These fossils must be identified and restored at the archologist. There is a wide arragement of items that can be the result of this digging, from ancient textbooks, magical weapons or old caches full of coins and gems. </p>
        <p align="center">The Process goes like this:</p>
        <p align="center">Find Fossil =&gt; Mine it =&gt; Identify (automatic) =&gt; Restore (automatic) =&gt; Get Item</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="3" id="3">Diseases</a></h1>
        <p align="center">You will encounter different diseases and plagues in the game. This can range from the chicken pox that erridcates all you avian lifestock, rabies that makes you guarddogs attack their masters, or the black death that ravages through your population. Different diseases have different sources of outbreakes and can either be prevented or fought.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="4" id="4">Magic</a></h1>
        <p align="center">There are four different types of magic in the game, one for each of the higher races. <strong>Dwarven magic</strong> is the magic of steel and fire, of adamantine and the spirit of the mountain. Great fighters and artefacts can be created by it, but fire is a dangerous ally. <strong>Human magic</strong> is based on prayer and holy relicts. It can heal and ressurect, invirogate your people and banish the undead. <strong>Elven magic</strong> comes from the earth. Natural resources, turning the forest against your enemies and using the forces of nature to your advantage. The <strong>last magic, Drow</strong>, is black magic. Dark energies are created from using blood, ash and bone, using the corpses of your enemies to summon demons or create abominations. This magic is highly dangerous, but powerful.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="5" id="5">Metalworking</a></h1>
        <p align="center">There is a slight change in metals in this mod. Iron-ore only give wrought iron. This is a form of weak, unrefinded iron. It has to be refined in the crucible first, before it can be used for the steel industry. That gives one extra workstep for iron and steel. Goblinite will partly consist of rusty iron. Similar concept, you have to refine it first in the crucible.</p>
        <p align="center">There are several new metals in the mod, the more important ones I will explain now: </p>
        <p align="center">Mithril is a new, lighter steel-grade metal. It has the same values as steel, but weights next to nothing. It is associated with silver, and can be found in or near silver veins and can be refined from silver. This is essentially an alternate way to get steel-grade metals without flux.</p>
        <p align="center">Tungsten, made from wolframite, is the heaviest metal you can make, and is excellent for blunt weapons. Only slade is heavier, but this will slow your dwarves down a lot.</p>
        <p align="center">Cobalt can be made from cobaltite and is an alternate iron-grade metal. It can not be used for the steel industry however.</p>
        <p align="center">Volcanic is the best metal dwarves can make on their own. Merging steel, obsidian, slade and mithril, powered by a magma forge, this is the ultimate in dwarven metals. Better then steel, with a set temperature and extra damage against Frost Giants.</p>
        <p align="center">Bifrost is a unique metal only dropped by dead frost giants. Better then anything but adamantine. Frost Giants themselves are immune to it however.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="l" id="52">Leatherworking</a></h1>
        <p align="center">There are four different kind of leather in the mod. Fur, Leather, Carapace and Scalemail. All are created in the tanner from different raw ingredients. You need a skin to make fur and leather, chitin for carapace and scale for scalemail. </p>
        <p align="center">Fur is very soft and should be used for clothing.</p>
        <p align="center">Leather, Carapace and Scalemail have the same value as the normal DF leather.</p>
        <p align="center">You can upgrade these three types by refining them in the tanner. You need to boil them in water to harden them. The hardened pieces can be made into lamellar leather by stringing several pieves together with thread. </p>
        <p align="center">Leather can also be used to make vellum for books and essays.</p>
        <p align="center">Leather can also be cut into suede, very thin leather, which is very soft and should only be used for bags or clothing. Armor made if suede is pointless.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="6" id="6">Library System</a></h1>
        <p align="center">You can train dwarves by using libraries and books to raise their skills. You need a scriptorium, the place to write the books, and libraries to read and store them. There are four different libraries, for Social, Mental, Combat and Labor skills. There is also the Philosophers Garden for the more... useless skills.</p>
        <p align="center">The entire process works like this:</p>
        <p align="center">Make paper/vellum/parchment =&gt; Make Ink =&gt; Bind Book =&gt; Write Book</p>
        <p align="center">You can now read in the book for a small skill increase, or study the book using textbooks, quills and ink, for a big skill increase.</p>
        <p align="center">Read about a topic =&gt; +30 exp. </p>
        <p align="center">Study a topic =&gt; Needs textbook, quill, ink =&gt; +300 exp.</p>
        <p align="center">There is also a small chance for a special book to be written. These books are the results of great sparks of inspiration of the author, grand masterworks of dwarven literatur. They can only be used once for a massive skill increase.</p>
        <p align="center">Read a masterpiece =&gt; +3000exp.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="7" id="7">Spawning Creatures</a></h1>
        <p align="center">It is possible to create friendly and hostile creatures in workshops. You cant get new civ members this way, nor can you get pets. But you can station friendly units that fight for you, as well as summon enemies to fight for special rewards. All spawning needs a reagent and the workshop &quot;spawn location&quot; I chose this neutral title because many different creatures can be made and sorting them after topics would have created to many different buildings.</p>
        <p align="center">How it works:</p>
        <p align="center">A dwarf does a reaction =&gt; Boiling stone is created =&gt; Dwarf breathes in the vapor =&gt; Dwarf is afflicted with syndrome that transforms him into a new creatures =&gt; New creature drops a bodypart that is resurrected =&gt; Resurrected bodypart is transformed into the creature you want to spawn.</p>
        <p align="center">Really. This is the only way to get new creatures. Crazy, I know. So please dont wonder why this might be buggy. It can have a 100% success rate, it can be 10%. It is unfortunately rather random, but there is nothing I can do about this. You dont like this fact, deactivate the feature in the Settings.</p>
        <p align="center">How it is used:</p>
        <p align="center">You can build the Spawn Location in corridors, your main entracen, near you trade depot or anywhere you want. All creatures that are created there will stay in that area. You cant move them, order them or pit them. So select a good spot in the first place. </p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="8" id="8">Armoring Animals</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Dwarves can armor their favourite warbeasts in different metals. What you need to do is build a Creature Armory and pasture the creatures you want to armor on it. Make a pasture-zone right on top of the workshop and get the animals there, before running any reactions. This works again by using boiling stones. </p>
        <p align="center">Once armored animals will essentially have metal skin and claws/teeth of the chosen type. They will behave like normal animals and can still be trained for war and assigned for dwarves.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="9" id="9">Golems</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Golems are among the mighiest warriors you can create. You encase a dwarf into a giant metal contruct that feels no pain, hunger or thrist, no need for sleep and no emotions. You can use a variety of metals and have three major weapons to chose from. Sword for cutting, Hammer for blunt and Spear for piercing attacks. The Golem will not do any labor however. </p>
        <p align="center">Assigning golems to do what you want from them is a bit tricky. There are two different golems to make it even more difficult:</p>
        <p align="center">Low grade golems can come with migrants or be ordered from the caravan. These you simply treat as pets. You war-train them, pasture them where you want them and you are good.</p>
        <p align="center">The transformed golems act like sentient creatures. The easiest way to control them is this: Make a golem a milita commander in the nobles screen. Then make a new squad. The Golem will automatically be the squad-leader. You can now give him movement, sation and kill orders.</p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="10" id="10">Landmines</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Landmines are stationary creatures that explode with a special effect. You can either buy them from caravans, or build them yourself. You have many different ones, from stunning your opponents, to blinding them, to setting them on fire. Most of them wont directly kill, but if used right, they do tremendous damage. If a landmine is destroyed from afar, or before it can trigger, the resulting explosion will be a lot smaller. They also do friendly fire, so dont have landmines and melee soldiers fighting the same enemies at the same time.</p>
        <p align="center">Small explanation of all landmine types and effects here</p>
        <p align="center">The best way to use them is probably to trap the invaders in a room and drop a landmine down a hatch. Think of medieval murder holes to know what I mean.</p>

        <h1 align="center"><a name="11" id="11">Turrets</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Turrets are stationary creatures that have a ranged attack and can fire through fortifications and even up or down z-levels. You can either buy them from caravans or build them yourself. They are a vast improvement over catapults and ballistas, because they are automated and wont flee whenever anything comes near. They also auto-reload and auto-aim. There are many different types, and just like landmines some of them do friendly fire, so position them wisely. Some start fires, so position those even more wisely.</p>
        <p align="center">Small explanation of all turret types and effects here</p>
        <p align="center">The best way to use them is on raised platforms, probably with a way to control their field of view, and a drawbridge that can be raised to protect them from enemy archers.</p>
