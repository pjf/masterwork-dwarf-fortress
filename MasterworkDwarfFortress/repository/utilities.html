I listed them all here, with a small explanation of each and a link directly to their official Threads at the Bay12-Forum.

        <p align="left">DF Hack is a program that directly interacts with the running DF-Game. Most people use it for cheating, but it can be a great utility to easy the management of greater fortresses, fix glitches, help your FPS and is an invaluable tool for modders, helping them to test their changes. It starts up automatically.  If you want to disable DF Hack, simply find and delete SDL.dll and rename SDLreal.dll in your DF directory to SDL.dll, to replace the old one.</p>
        <p align="left">See the included <a href="Readme.html" target="_blank">readme</a> for more info.      </p>
        <p align="left">IMPORTANT: The poison coating and steam engine both do require dfhack to be active.</p>
        <p align="left">This mod also adds 7 custom plugins written by falconne. These are only GUI improvements and do not change the game balance. For more infos see <a href="http://dffd.wimbli.com/file.php?id=7248" target="_blank">here</a> or the included <a href="pluginsreadme.txt" target="_blank">readme</a>.</p>
        <p align="left">Another set of plugins comes from Vjek, they are mostly to alter specific dwarves. You can find the full readme on these  <a href="readme vjek.txt" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
