          <p align="left"><em> Uruks are about 50/% larger than snaga -- only these larger orcs can effectively equip a great-axe or daikatana with a shield.  Snaga usually have the agility to be deadly with bows, but lack the strength to use blunt weapons with poor leverage (i.e., clubs).  Try to give your orcs equipment that matches their skills (you'll never go too far wrong with scimitars, jagged axes, and jagged spears).

        <p align="center">::: Economizing on Raiding Gear :::</p>
        <p align="left">The Raiders Drydock is used not only to strike back at 
        the &#39;Free&#39; Peoples and grab some loot, but also to round up goblins, 
        steal blueprints and codexes -- things that unlock more powerful 
        buildings or abilities for 
        your Orcs.&nbsp; To support the Drydock you&#39;ll need a source of rusty 
        iron coins, ballista parts, plenty of wood, and also Weapons.&nbsp; 
        Exchanging bounties at the Freelancer&#39;s guild is usually the best source 
        of coins, but you might also mint coins from rusty iron bars you get from 
        Molten Pit or Goblin trading partners.&nbsp; If you are short on wood 
        but have plenty of cloth and pulleys, consider sail-powered Xebecs 
        instead of regular Longboats.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t have junk weapons 
        laying around, forge weapons with the smallest materials requirement 
        like daggers, or save on materials by batch production at the Orcish 
        Factory.&nbsp;

        <p>Don&#39;t be afraid of aquifer embarks!&nbsp; Orcs have lots of tools 
        available to make strong mostly- and even entirely-above ground forts, 
        starting with the arms and armor from the Tribal Warcrafter and 
        Fletcher, and Boneyard for mechanisms.&nbsp; Trade for cheap raw 
        materials from the Goblins civilization if they are active.&nbsp; Once 
        you get your drydock and Raiding crews on line, you can raid the Elves for wood, the 
        Dwarves for metal, or the Merchant&#39;s Guild to begin founding a 
        caravanserai and expand your purchasing options.&nbsp; In the meantime, 
        if you can get the Orcish Factory or Goblin Sawmill up and running, you 
        can stretch your supplies of 
<em>
        clay </em>and
<em>
        wood </em>farther.&nbsp; </tr>

		Orcs can do a lot with leather, bone, and blood at the Tribal Craftsorc 
        and Fletcher, so you might want to get Ranchers or Hunters industry 
        going early.&nbsp; Embarking with some birds or ranching animals is 
        usually more efficient use of points than paying for leather or quivers 
        directly.</tr>

        <p align="center">::: Organizing Tool Stockpiles :::</p>
        <p>There are lots of new items in Orc Fortress, and a lot of them are 
        stockpiled as Tools.&nbsp; Use Materials setting in your stockpile to 
        control which type of tools goes where.&nbsp; For example: elven 
        enchanted toolkits should always be mithril, while warrior society 
        codexes should always be steel.</tr>

        Harder Smithing setting &amp; Artisan Craft 
        Efficiency :::</strong></em></p>
        Orc Fortress is balanced assuming the "Harder Smithing" setting is on.  Many of the custom reactions will cost a similar amout of material to Harder Smithing, and some will have efficiency savings like the batch processes at the factory.  If you play Normal Smithing, the tradeoffs will be different, and in many cases you might be just better off with more ordinary forges.

        <p align="left">Your Raiders will sometimes bring back a &quot;Dwarven (etc.) 
        Captive&quot;.&nbsp; In an embark with shortages of materials like wood, 
        stone, or cloth, the Labor Cell workshop can be invaluable, but careful 
        because the laborers will go through food or drink pretty fast.&nbsp; If 
        you bring them a big stack of food, they&#39;ll produce more output, but 
        they&#39;ll still eat it all.&nbsp; If you play Harder Farming you&#39;ll 
        need a large food production capacity to use captive labor with any 
        regularity.&nbsp; You can also ransom 
        the captives at the Shadowbroker for a random  large sum of coins and a 
        commemorative statue, suitable for mounting in your trophy hall.</tr>

        <p align="left">Orc Fortress already had its own &quot;slag&quot; system that is 
        different from the one implemented in Masterwork.&nbsp; When you use the 
        Orcish Molten Pit to smelt batches of ore or destroy trash gear, you 
        have a chance to produce low-value (but possibly useful) rusty iron, 
        dolomite, malachite, or potash.&nbsp; If you really like slag you can 
        turn on the Masterwork system too; the Orcs now have access to the 
        Dwarf-style slag pit for processing &quot;slag bars&quot;.</tr>

        <p align="center">::: Magma Engineering :::</p>
        <p>There is lots you can do with the Magma Source and you should 
        experiment, but here is an idea of how to get started.&nbsp; * Build a 
        rail line with one end near your source station and the other at the 
        edge of the target: cistern, aquifer to be obsidianized, river to be dammed, etc. * 
        Build a stop at both ends. the end by the cistern should auto-dump 
        towards the cistern. * Create a tram route set to &quot;push cart when 
        greater than 50% full,&quot; note that using the &quot;guide&quot; setting can put 
        workers in splash-danger. * Create a return condition &quot;guide when empty&quot; 
        * Add a magmatanker to the route * Set magmasource to fill the tanker using manager.</p>
        <p>Magma/water cisterns are filled by Orcs carrying the &quot;magma filled 
        bottle&quot; item created at the Source station, and will release the fluid 
        when deconstructed.&nbsp; You may want to rig a support cave in to do 
        this remotely. Workshops seems to be able to fill it&#39;s own area plus 
        about one ring around (assuming it has enough magma inside). So a 1 tile 
        workshop can fill a 3x3 space, and a 3x3 shop can fill 5x5 space.

        <p>Spellcrafting reactions require specific material like silver and 
        gold for the druidic magic at the Stone Circle, and bloodsteel and iron 
        for sorcerers magic at the Altar of Storms.&nbsp; You may want to 
        consider the resources on hand if you are choosing one school of magic 
        over the other.&nbsp; They also require small quantities of specific 
        rare gems like emerald, sapphires, or clear diamonds.&nbsp; If you lack 
        silver, gold, or rare gems, look to your Raiders to attack merchant 
        shipping, or equip thieves at the Kobold Trackers hut.</tr>
