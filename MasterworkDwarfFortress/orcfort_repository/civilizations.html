<h1 align="center"><font size="5"><a name="setting">Suggested Settings</a></font></h1>


<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Masterwork Settings which affect only the
Dwarven entity or creature won&#39;t have an effect on Orc Fortress; this includes
most of the Workshop settings, and Castes.&nbsp; Masterwork settings which
affect the World or non-Dwarf animals *will* impact Orc Fortress: this includes
Harder Farming, Mining, Aquifers, Grazing, Weather, all Materials, all
Creatures, all Cavern settings, meteoric iron, etc.&nbsp; Therapist also works
fine with Orcs.&nbsp; The Orc Fortress custom workshops and reactions are
generally balanced assumed Harder Farming and Harder Smithing being both ON.&nbsp;
Other than that most any combinations should work fine although, please let me
know if you identify any problems.&nbsp; </p>


<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to other civilizations, Humans, Dwarves, Elves and Drow, and
Automatons will be powerful enemies.&nbsp; Goblins, Deep-drow, Chaos-dwarves,
Bandits, and Elf-rebels are potentially friends.&nbsp; (Wild-Orcs, Warlocks, and
Frost Giants aren&#39;t really suggested for use at this time.)&nbsp; Fortress
Defense races will attack you too; note that the &quot;medium&quot; tier are about a match
in raw size and strength.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some suggested groupings, but of
course, experiment to see what you like best!</p>


<p align="left">Orc Fortress Basic <br>
* Get off to a strong start with some early help from greenskin cousins<br>
Enemies: Dwarves, Elves, Tigermen, Antmen<br>
Friends: Goblins</p>


<p align="left">Orc Fortress Classic<br>
* Prepare to fight for survival against irregular ambush and siege warfare<br>
Enemies:&nbsp; Dwarves, Humans, Elves, Drow, Trogs, Antmen<br>
Friends:&nbsp; -none-</p>


<p align="left">Orc Fortress Defense <br>
* Match brute strength and engineering skill against assaults from more
straightforwardly aggressive enemies<br>
Enemies:&nbsp; Dwarves, Elves, Automatons, Serpentmen, Tigermen, Badgermen,
Pandashi, Minotaurii, Trogs, Antmen<br>
Friends:&nbsp; Human bandits </p>


<p align="left">Age of the Taiga-Orcs<br>
* Still some action, but lower difficulty for project forts<br>
Enemies:&nbsp; Dwarves, Drow, Frogmen, Tigermen, Ferric Elves, Trogs<br>
Friends:&nbsp; Human bandits, Elven rebels, Deep Drow</p>


<h1 align="center"><font size="5"><a name="ambush">&nbsp;Early Dangers &amp;
Ambushes</a></font></h1>


<p align="left">ELF rangers begin Ambushes as soon as the first half of Year
Two, and there&#39;s no way to know whether the first group will be spear- or
bow-elves. Either way these elves are armed to the teeth, quite unlike their
wooden-sword toting cousins. No anvil? Try the tribal warcrafter, or perhaps buy
a couple weapons from the freelancer&#39;s guild. Wrestlers with simple shields can
provide cover and subdue elves while your armed warlord provides the killing
blow. Of course you could just shut the gate, but you&#39;ll be missing out on the
bounty: Once you round up the elves weapons, and perhaps refit their scavenged
small armor scraps into makeshift mithril mail at the Molten Pit, you&#39;ll be in
business. </p>


<p align="left">DROW will also ambush you, maybe not quite as early.&nbsp; Make
sure to secure entrances with something stronger than a door, because they often
have deadly building-destroying Voracious Cave Crawlers, or other nasty
underground warbeasts like Jabberers.&nbsp; VCCs can be very dangerous to
unskilled militia or civilians, but fall easily enough to archers.&nbsp; </p>


<h1 align="center"><font size="5"><a name="siege">Dealing with Sieges</a></font></h1>


<p align="left">DWARF squads will often wait out and siege your fort. After a
few seasons of beating elves to death with their own tiaras, you&#39;ll feel that
Taiga Orcs are more than a match for the Free Peoples, and be ready to just
throw the gates open and meet them in honorable melee. &nbsp;Before this, check their
armament. The quality of both Dwarf and Human squads depends a lot on what kind
of gear and warbeasts they bring.&nbsp; Dwarves have access to heavy armor and
excellent materials, martial trances make their weaponmasters deadly, and a few
castes like Legion dwarves are tough enough to go toe to toe with your Uruks.&nbsp;
The majority of standard orcish weapons like axes, swords, and jagged arrows are
slashing type, so until you have advanced materials you may have trouble
punching through heavy armor or even golem&#39;s armor plating.&nbsp; Try to get
some guns, damascene weapons, upgraded bows or enchanted arrows, or simply mix
in some blunt/piercing melee weapons.</p>

<p align="left">HUMANS carry gunpowder weapons and cannons in particular can be
deadly. Decent armor might keep you alive, but you&#39;ll prefer block and dodge to
avoid gunshot wounds entirely and stay on your feet.&nbsp; If you normally play
more engineering/defensively, note that Dwarf and Human sieges can last a very
long time and may (or, may not ^^) ignore open gates into your base. Once you
know where they are likely to camp you might want to set up towers, ballistae,
tramcart weapons, cave in traps, magma landmines, an obsidianizer, some
Flachette gun traps loaded up with poison darts, a refuse pile filled with dead
jabberers ready to cast Raise Dead upon, or just some plain old weapon &amp; cage
traps ahead of their next visit.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><a name="primitives">Sub-orcish Primitives</a></font></p>
<p align="left">GNOMES, despite their supposed technological wizardry, are
laughably weak enemies, although they may pose some minor danger to an
unprepared clan with their gunpowder weapons.</p>
<p align="left">TIGERMEN are a limited threat because of their poor access to
armor and materials, but fight valiantly in a melee, being savage and somewhat
larger in build than any orc.&nbsp; When defeated they are a pretty good source
of copper, and of course, tiger leather pelts.</p>
<p align="left">TROGLODYTES should not be underestimated; they can be quite
dangerous to under-trained Orcs due to their natural skills in melee combat.&nbsp;
If you attempt a cavern embark then be prepared, they may siege from the
underground fairly early.</p>
<p align="left">ANTMEN are quite dangerous in large groups, and of course it&#39;s
tempting to simply wall them out and ignore them.&nbsp; However they carry a ton
of gear, since each warrior has 4 arms, and an intrepid warchief can turn all
those rusty iron gear into enough Weapon kits or minted Orcish shillings to keep
the raider&#39;s drydock in business for months.</p>
<p align="left">FOUL BLENDECS feel no pain and avoid traps, making them proof
against simple trap corridors that can destroy early enemies Tigermen.&nbsp;
Still, they are no match for a reasonably equipped orcish warband.&nbsp; They
can be looted for tin.</p>
<p align="left">SERPENTMEN are slight of build, but they have bronze tier
materials and armor and a variety of other advantages.&nbsp; They often have
bows or shields, are amphibious, have poisonous bite, avoid traps, and can bring
dangerous warbeasts since their civilizations deploy Beast Hunters.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><a name="worthy">Other Worthy Enemies</a></font></p>
<p align="left">BADGERMEN are as large as an Uruk, have good weapons, can enter
a berserk state, and sometimes bring dangerous &quot;dwarflike&quot; pets like Cave
crawlers and prototype golems.&nbsp; However, they&#39;re vulnerable to traps.&nbsp;
They are a pretty good opponent for a &quot;fair fight&quot; against orcish
squads.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">PANDASHII are a powerful enemy, just a bit larger than Uruks,
but with excellent natural melee skills, avoid traps, and ambush.</p>
<p align="left">RAPTORMEN are about the same size as Orcs, and mostly notable
for being amphibious and able to pick locked doors.</p>
<p align="left">AUTOMATONS will also be hostile.&nbsp; As in Dwarf mode, they
are organized into specialized models which each have high degree of mastery of
a particular skill.&nbsp; Their metallic skin may provide some proof against
jagged arrows.</p>
<p align="left">HARPIES are about the same size as Orcs, and can fly.</p>
<p align="left">MINOTAURS are about 3 times the size of an Orc, have good
natural skills, can forge steel, and are building destroyers. </p>
<p align="left">JOTUNAR lack the hard-as-steel icy skin and elite weapon skills
of Masterwork Frost Giants, but whatever they lack, they make up for it in raw
size and power.&nbsp; The smallest caste of Jotun are still 10x larger than a
Frost Giant, or roughly 80x larger than an Orc.&nbsp; Of course, this doesn&#39;t
make them invincible; after all elephants are almost so big too.&nbsp; What
makes them invincible is the kits of steel gear and ability to wield fire magic.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><a name="allies">Potential Allies</a></font></p>
<p align="left">ELVEN ASHLANDER glassblowers are renowned for the brilliant
colored stains and strong alloys they work from the grey wasteland sands.&nbsp;
They will bring for trade the blueprints for glassblowers shops, crates of raw
moonstone required for crafting weapons-grade ashland glass, spellswords&#39; tomes
filled with reality-bending spells, and healing tomes filled with beneficial
magics.</p>
<p align="left">DEEP DROW traders occassionally venture to the surface world to
barter mysterious goods from the underdark.&nbsp; They will bring blueprints for
the Nethermill, crates of raw netherwood and devilthorn for the mill,
destruction tomes filled with elemental spells, along with bloodsteel, ironbone,
and fine silk from the depths.</p>
<p align="left">HUMAN BANDITS make good allies for gunner-warbands; they will bring
gun ammo, bronze, iron, and blueprints for the Buccaneer&#39;s Tavern.</p>
<p align="left">CHAOS DWARVEN LEGION are bound by strange and terrible oaths to
a dark aspect of the blood god Armok. Their traders will bring some advanced metals like patternwelded
wolfram and steel, trap components and engineering supplies, and blueprints for
the Legion auxilla outpost, as well as the dark magic contained in the legion
arcanii tome.</p>
<p align="left">GOBLINS will visit multiple times per year, bringing lots of
low-grade basic supplies like cloth, rusty iron bars, and cheap weapons, cages,
and misc goods.&nbsp; This kind of mundane stuff can make all the difference in
early years -- you&#39;d much rather face down a murderous elf assassin with a rusty
iron flail than with nothing!&nbsp; They sometimes also bring goblin tinker type
stuff such as prototype golems and turrets.</p>
<p align="left">WILD ORCS don&#39;t have the same quality of gear as the taiga
clans.&nbsp; They can be decent trade partners at times, but since they tend to
come at the same time as the home caravan, their usefulness is limited.</p>
<p align="left">FROST GIANTS will bring a basic assortment of goods,
particularly those made from wolfram.</p>
<p align="left">WARLOCKS don&#39;t make good allies, due to their unstable and
dangerous relationship with magic.&nbsp; </p>
