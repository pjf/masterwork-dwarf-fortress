<h1 align="center"><a name="intro">Orc Fortress</a></h1>

<p>  For many years, the dominion of the Orcs was complete, and none of the so-called "civilizations" would dare violate the eternal hunting grounds.   Our fathers' fathers culled the elves in primeval forests as a jaguar stalks its prey.  Mighty Uruk warriors blazed trails at will through steppe and villages alike with axe and fire. Only Dwarf-kind managed any opposition to our rule, and even an assault from the lowest of our goblin cousins would drive them cowering behind the walls of their Fortress homes.

<p>But ours is not that era.  Ours is the time of Masterwork Dwarf Fortress, where the Dwarves and Elves have mastered elite arts of metallurgy and warcraft.  Even the hapless humans have learned to defend themselves, in their awkward way, with their lumbering suits of steel and random blasts of musketry.  Orcs have been driven from their traditional homelands into bleak, marginal reservations in the cold and dark 
taiga.

<p>Trapped between the mithril spears of the elves and the cruel frozen seas, the Orcs know that they must adopt civilization and industry or else perish. Orcish survivors have banded together, bitterly calling themselves the "Taiga Clans" and swearing revenge.  You are now called upon to reclaim our lands, to stake out resources.  Our numbers are too few, so you will travel not with a horde at your back.  You will have a crew of just 7 orcs; if you are particularly lucky you may have one decent warrior or smith in the bunch.  More likely, your crew will be a sorry lot of peasants, shaman, and snaga.  You will be under constant assault by the Dwarves, Humans, and Drow, and if you are unlucky mithril-armed Elves may ambush as early as spring of Year 2!  The so-called "Fortress Defense" civilizations refuse our emissaries as well and can be counted as enemies.

<p>The first order of business is survival.  The various clans have brought efficient recipies for leatherworking, dark rituals for crafting tribal bloodsteel weapons, and traditions of bowyery and fletching that served for centuries in great hunts of elves.  We may too find allies in these lands:  Our goblin cousins will happily trade what pitiful wares that they can, and you might chose to settle near outcast criminal bands of Humans, Dwarves, Drow, or even Elves who would make fine trade partners.

<p>But your ambition is greater.  You still remember the burnt husk of the Factory of the Black Citadel, whose furnaces once consumed the entire great midland forests, and are sure that your minions could recreate it if given enough resources.  You still have your pirate contacts from the Freelancer's Guild, and you know that for a few coins these corsairs can acquire enough weapons to arm a mercenary army.  Perhaps these rogues could even steal some technology from your enemies -- What damage could a proper Orc commander inflict with a regiment of rifles; with dwarven mail; with 
elven bows and drowish magicks?  From the deep-orcs of the mountains, you have claimed the lost secrets of metal-folding, and you foresee a day when your Uruks wield razor sharp damascene blades instead of crude choppas.  No matter what tools you choose, you know that victory is in your grasp.  For the clans!  For vengeance!  To WAAAAAAAAGH!



<h1 align="center"><a name="1">Orcs and Castes</a></h1>

        <p> There are three main castes in Taiga Orc civilization.   The standard <b>"Orc"</b> caste are most similar to their feral Orcish brethren, and the baseline to which other Orcs are compared.  They are very strong, and quite agile, and are about  a bit larger than humans.  They learn leatherworking and bonecarving readily, and take quickly to dodging, wrestling, and melee combat.  However, orcs learn brewing, gemwork, mining and stone-detailing more slowly than dwarves.  A hard life in a hard land has endowed the 
        Taiga Orcs with fine intuition and patience, but Orcs are lacking in other mental attributes and are mediocre students.</p>

        <p>About 1 in 8 Taiga orcs are born into the <b>"Uruk"</b> caste, descended from the mighty nomadic tribes of the steppes.  They have legendary strength, toughness, and recuperation.  Since they are about 10% again larger than their clansmates, Uruks can wield vicious great-axes and longswords to deadly effect, 
        generally even one handed.  Finally, they are the only Orc to enter a Martial Trance, making them the core of any horde which hopes to face worthy enemies in melee.

        <p>About 2 in 8 Taiga orcs are born into the <b>"Snaga"</b> caste, rumored to have mixed Goblin blood in their ancestry.  They are small and weak, like a goblin, but some have grudgingly earned respect as archers in Taiga warbands due to their remarkable agility.  Of course, more traditionally minded warchiefs assign the honor of such victories to the clan's master fletcher, considering the snaga themselves to be little more than disposable tools.

        <p>About 5% of Taiga orcs are <b>"Artisans"</b>, rare creative minds who make good bone-, leather-or wood-crafts orcs.  Although Orcish smiths are best known for the terrible spectacle of their crude factories and slag pits, 
        Taiga-clan artisans also remember some of the secret arts of metal folding and fletchery passed down from their clanfathers.

        <p>About 5% of Taiga orcs are <b>"Dreamwalkers"</b>, weird frail creatures who are nevertheless feared and honored for their mental prowess.  Dreamwalkers are adept priests and doctors, and they can often read and write -- even using numbers on occasion.  Female Dreamwalkers are revered among the dwindling tribes for they often have litters of multiple young.  When called upon to join the warbands, Dreamwalkers seek out special arcane weapons which channel dark aspects of their 
        wild magics, while a few undertake spirit journeys in the hope of becoming powerful 
        Sorcerers or Druids.

        <p>About 5% of Taiga orcs are <b>"Corsairs"</b>, Orcs taken with a passion for buccaneering and adventure.  Renowned for their skill with fire-arms and ballistae, the Corsairs true value to the clans is an uncanny ability to accurately assess the value of trade and plunder.

        <p>About 2% of Taiga orcs are <b>"Ronin"</b>, casteless uruk who hope to barter their skill in arms for a place with honor in a new clan.  In the frontier settlements, ronin are greatly sought after as 
        sergeants, trainers, and even warchiefs.  Male ronin train primarily with the sword, while female ronin traditionally prefer the bow.

        <h1 align="center"><a name="2">Taiga-orc Society and Nobles</a>        </h1>

	    Taiga Orcs have nobles, but organized a bit differently than the Dwarves.

        <p> The <b><i>&quot;clan leader&quot;</i></b> oversees the day to day affairs of an orcish expedition, receiving diplomats and meeting with workers.  The clan leader is expected to stay on the job in larger settlements even after other greater nobles arrive.

        <p> The <b><i>&quot;warchief&quot;</i></b> is the leader of a clan's military forces.

        <p> One or more <b>"scribes"</b> can be appointed, and each takes on the responsibilities of both Accounting and Production management.

        <p> One or more <b>"shaman"</b> can be appointed.  Shaman are required for medical diagnoses, and also can help calm angry orcs.

        <p> The orc designated <b>"speaker"</b> takes responsibility for trade.

        <p> An <b>"executioner"</b>, if appointed, is the sole embodiment of the rule of law in any clan-holding without a huscarl.

        <p> When a clan grows to the notice of the central confederation, a <b>"Thain"</b> 
        is appointed to ensure the clan&#39;s survival.&nbsp; The Thain is a 
        hereditary position and may be promoted to Hersir or Jarl as the clan 
        continues to grow.&nbsp; As Jarls rise through the ranks they may chose 
        to appoint clan champions including the Huscarl, Battlemage, and 
        Avenger.</body></html>
