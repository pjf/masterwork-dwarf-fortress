<h1>Freelancers and Raiders</h1>
<p><img src="screenshots/freelancers.png"></p>

<p>Freelancers are Orcish adventurers who have left the Tiaga clans and forged
connections within the seedier elements of society in the world at large.  They
will buy and sell goods for cash, and unlike other markets, they are happy to
perform transactions in Orcish currency â€” rusty iron shillings.  You can get
shillings from them for bountys (totems and blood), by selling them nautical
equipment (grog, cloth, and pulleys), or by fencing large gems, gold &amp;
silver coins. You can also buy weapons and ammo -- either for your own use, or
to equip raiding parties.  The Freelancers' Guild is the easiest source for
pistols and firearm ammo.  The "corsairs arms" consists of a pistol and knife
(which are wielded together), and is a pretty good deal.  Don't forget, you can
always mint your own coins at the forge for 1 bar per 500, this is one way to
use up rusty iron in the fort.</p>

<p>Prices subject to change, please see your local Freelancers' guild rep for current rates.  Terms and conditions may apply.</p>

<h2>Raiders Drydock</h2>

<p><img src="screenshots/raiders_drydock.png"></p>

<p>Dwarves may be content to lurk meekly in defense of their ivory spires and
adamant halls, but Orcs prefer to sow vengeance among the home lands of their
foes.  From the Raiders' Drydock you can equip a longboat with weapons and
enough coin for a crew of Freelancers to depart on a expedition of your
choosing.  The crew are likely to perish forgotten and alone in a distant land;
but there is a chance they may return instead with an assortment of plundered
metals, powerful weapons, or even rare blueprints &amp; artifacts for the clan
Artisians and Dreamwalkers to study. Drydocks <em>must</em> be constructed outside,
and you are encouraged to build them adjacent to a body of water for maximum
thematic effect.</p>

<p>A raiding crew needs three items for their journey:  A raiding boat, a bundle
of weapons, and a number (usually 5000) of rusty iron coins for expenses.  The
boat is normally a longboat, constructed at the drydock from 10 wood logs and 3
ballista parts.  Some clan leaders will try to save wood by using xebec ships
instead, even though these require cloth and pulleys.  The weapons bundle is
made from any 5 weapons; even daggers or cheap factory produced gear will be
fine.  There is a 50% chance that the boat and the weapons bundle survive the
journey.  Coins can be obtained at the Freelancer's Guild or minted at the
forge, and the Raiders will spend this money no matter what.  If successful,
the raid will produce a loot crate with can be opened at the drydock.</p>

<p>The loot you can get is random, and depends very much on the target!  For
example, elves may yield wood and saplings, elven weapons, enchanted arrows or
raw mithril.  A raid on dwarves might yield precious metals, weapons, and rare
weapon-grade alloys.</p>

<h2>Goblin &amp; Kobold Ghetto</h2>

<p>Goblin and Kobold workers are normally picked up by your
Raiders, if you send them on a special trip to a village in the hinterlands.
These voyages are much higher probability of success than raids into hostile
territories, but still requires a boat, weapon kit, and some shillings.
You can also sometimes rescue a gob or kob ship's mate from a Merchant raid, or
you can always just fork over cash to the Shadowbroker to smuggle workers in.
Until deployed into their workshop, Goblin workers will be stored along with
other useful items in your Tools stockpile.</p>

<h3>Goblin Stonecutter's Shanty</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/goblin_stonecutter.png"></p>

<p><strong>The Stonecutter's Shanty</strong> houses a goblin masonry apprentice and his workshop.
He takes on tasks which are beneath the notice of Orcish masons, like grinding
excess stone, sorting the magma-safe rocks from others, crafting rock weapons
and traps, and cutting blocks
back apart into stone. He can also make rock bins and barrels, although be
warned that they can be pretty heavy.</p>

<h3>Goblin Sawmill Shanty</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/goblin_sawmill.png"></p>

<p><strong>The Sawmill Shanty</strong> houses a goblin woodworker and his shop. The goblin
woodworker is excellent at stretching limited resources; he can cut 20
planks
from 5 logs. He can even make big batches of 10 bins or barrels from 5
logs, as long as he has access to some metal for fasteners.</p>

<h3>Goblin Tinkerer Shanty</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/goblin_tinkerer.png"></p>

<p><strong>The Tinkerer's Shanty</strong> houses a goblin who can craft advanced
flachette guns, pistols, and muskets (although the last, only by using up a
stolen human toolkit). He can also hand-load rounds for guns, making his
own black powder from scratch without help of a chemist. Since the
tinkerer uses so much brass and lead, he has his own small low-temperature
furnace to help with smelting a few basic ores.</p>

<h3>Kobold Poisoner's Hut</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/kobold_poisoner.png"></p>

<p><strong>The Poisoner's Hut</strong> houses a kobold who creates and applies poison to ammo,
weapons, and trap components. Besides using a number of poison recipes
stolen from the Free Peoples, the kobold poisoner has developed a few extra
poisons from Wetland and Boreal plants: an improved universal Blight poison
distilled from kobold-bulb and cadaverine, and a Pinkskin Bane poison from
icicle mint and Taiga bloodberry.</p>

<h3>Kobold Hunter's Hut</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/kobold_tracker.png"></p>

<p><strong>The Hunter's Hut</strong> can equip kobold thieves with a dagger and bag, and send
them out into the world with a chance to steal some precious metals and gems
for the clan. He can also forge batches of darts, useful if the Goblin Tinkerer
is providing the troops with flachette guns.  Flachette guns have a good rate
of fire and so dart batches can be effective for training up a gun warband if
metal guns &amp; ammo are in low supply. They also make fine trap components,
perhaps in combination with poisoned darts.</p>

<h3>Kobold Textile Hut</h3>

<p><img src="screenshots/kobold_textile.png"></p>

<p><strong>The Kobold Textile Hut</strong> can batch produce sets of clothing from cloth, wool,
or silk; and can process grasses to wicker. Wicker bins are valued for
their light weight in any fort, and other wicker furniture can be in great
demand in overland camps. He can also practice a few tribal
weavers' tricks such as weaving rope from rope-reed, and stripping wood-stalks
down to logs.</p>

<h2>Labor Cells</h2>

<p><img src="screenshots/laborcells.png"></p>

<p><strong>The Labor Cells</strong> are a special case. Sometimes your Raiders will take
captive a Dwarf, Drow, Elf or Human. Large clanholdings generally pass
these captives quickly through contacts at the Caravanserai's Shadowbroker
for a significant ransom. However, camps which are short on simple
materials such as stone, silk, wood, or basic crafts can choose to deploy these
guests as laborers, although their work presents a significant drain on food
resources.</p>
