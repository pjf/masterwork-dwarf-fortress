<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h3>How do I get scalps?</h3>

<p>Scalps are automatically harvested when you butcher the corpses of worthy enemies ("Civilisations" in Masterwork Dwarf Fortress). However automatons drop gears instead of scalps, and frost giants drop bifrost instead.</p>

<p>Tanning a scalp is an automatic reaction that occurs at the tannery. You may wish to build extra tanning workshops if you're butchering many enemies.</p>

<h3>How do I make a spirit talisman?</h3>

<p>Spirit Talismen are woven from greater souls, and drop from the same enemies as those that drop scalps. Frost giants and automatons also produce greater souls.</p>

<p>Weaving spirit talismen is an automatic reaction. If you're butchering many enemies, you may wish to build extra totem poles to help speed their processing.</p>

<h3>How do I make ironbone and bloodsteel?</h3>

<p>Both of these are made at the totem pole. While any orc can make them, they use the prayer/shaman (aka STRAND_EXTRACTION) labour, which is of particular use to dreamwalkers.</p>
