<h3 align="left"><b><i>Vale of Tears</i></b></h3>
<p align="left">His name was once legend among your clan - Aguur&#39;thashum, the
Black Arrow.&nbsp; He came up through the ranks as a line grunt in a resistance
warband protecting the last of the Orcish Druids&#39; Places of Power.&nbsp; When
the deep forests were finally lost to the elves, he lead a battered and rag-tag
group in a desperate battle for survival, leaving only ash in their wake.&nbsp;
Ultimately, he found himself hunting alone in the darkest corners of the elder
kingdoms, striking at Elven princelings with single arrows fletched with ravens&#39;
plumes.&nbsp; Now the Black Arrow is a shadow of his former self, blind with age
and crippled with old scars, and forgotten by many of the young warchiefs vying
for favor.&nbsp; He has cashed in all his remaining favors with the Clan Council
to outfit one final expedition and counts on you to see it through.&nbsp; The
time for subtlety, for knives in the dark, has passed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Goals:&nbsp; Embark with the &quot;Forest Clan&quot; profile in a
region with both Elves and Elven Bandits.&nbsp; Initiate war with both.&nbsp;
Build a camp with at least 3 Elven Labor Cells and 1 Goblin Sawmill.&nbsp; Build
an above ground temple exclusively from wood and embellished with mithril, large
enough for a Stone Circle and 3 totem poles, and housing.&nbsp; House in the
temple at least 3 Druids, plus their assistant Dreamwalkers and any other worthy
acolytes you see fit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Tips:&nbsp; Use the Raiders Drydock to get Elven laborers
and Goblin migrants.&nbsp; A Druidic codex can be either crafted or obtained on
a raid; then use it at the Stone Circle to enlighten your Dreamwalkers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bonus 1: Burn, melt, butcher, or destroy any items looted
from elvish invaders or stolen from traders (using Raiders&#39; plunder is fair
game). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bonus 2:&nbsp; Capture a Treesinger&#39;s Pagoda and ensnare
the ancient spirits of the forest to give fairwood and mithril as tribute for
the temple.</p>
<h3 align="left"><i>The Old Ways</i></h3>
<p align="left">When the enemy marched on the Great Clanholding, your kin held
the pass at Bitter Narrows for hours.&nbsp; The entire council of elders
escaped, and you held the ford.&nbsp; The other supposed &quot;warlords&quot; escaped, and
still your folk alone held the ford.&nbsp; In the end your father sent you away
with an oath to safeguard the clan in his stead.&nbsp; He fell fighting back to
back with his brothers, after exacting a terrible toll from the human vanguard.&nbsp;
A near escape and a long bitter winter followed, but of course, you endured.&nbsp;
Yesterday, a clan liaison arrived to announce that due to your greatly
diminished numbers, your clan-holding was being dissolved.&nbsp; Your kin are to
disperse into the towns.&nbsp; You are to report for training as a shieldbearer
second-class in support of a new professional pike-and-musket battalion, modeled
after some human tactical nonsense.&nbsp; Today, the liaison woke up at sunrise,
confused and alone in his fine silken tent.&nbsp; You, your tribe, and your
herds were visible only as a cloud of dust on the horizon.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Goals:&nbsp; Embark with the &quot;Steppe Clan&quot; profile.&nbsp;
Equip at least 15 soldiers with gear from the traditional Jaguar, Falcon, or
Dragon Warrior Societies.&nbsp; Record 50 or more kills of Human or Dwarven
troops in melee or with ranged attacks from Society wargear.&nbsp; All snaga-caste
orcs must live in a separate complex and are forbidden from melee combat,
crafting, and metalworking.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Tips:&nbsp; Use the Tribal wargear, Fletcher, Damasc shop,
and/or Forge to craft traditional weapons, and combine them into Society Wargear
at the meadhall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bonus 1:&nbsp; Embark on an aquifer (you may adjust the
embark to bring stone)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bonus 2:&nbsp; Since you are estranged from the central
Clan Council, set the population cap to 80 or less.</p>
<h3 align="left"><i>Thunderguard</i></h3>
<p align="left">Your clan traces its lineage back to the Orcish Sorcerer-kings
of the deep.&nbsp; When you were young, your great-uncle would unlock the old
stockpiles to show you the mechanized crossbows, the automata, the black powder
and strange runic weapons.&nbsp; But your uncle was no sorcerer, nor even a
mechanist, and the ancient weapons were rusted and decrepit after long decades
of neglect.&nbsp; In any case the stockpiles were lost to the Drow years ago in
the Underdark wars.&nbsp; Your clan is now diminished almost to a feral pack of
animals, scavenging for scraps in the moonlight, hiding in caves from Human
outriders from dawn to dusk.&nbsp; You agree with your cousin, the chief, on a
desperate mission: you will take a small team of picked Orcs, build a secret
holding deep below the hills, and rebuild a devastating arsenal in relative
safety.&nbsp; Only once you have the strength to finally break your enemies will
you reveal yourself to the surface world again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Goals:&nbsp; Embark with the &quot;Mountain Clan&quot; profile in a
region without Human Bandit trade partners.&nbsp; Delve directly to the 1st or
2nd cavern; anything built above the 1st cavern must be made of Factory-produced
blocks, metal, or obsidian.&nbsp; Equip at least 20 soldiers with gunpowder
weapons including at least 5 Seawolf or Lifeguard Society arms kits.&nbsp;
Ultimately build an citadel and obelisk on the surface as a beacon for your
scattered clan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Tips:&nbsp; Buy ammo at the Freelancers&#39; Guild or craft it
at the Goblin Tinkerer.&nbsp; Gunpowder weapons are available at the Freelancer
or Tinkerer; by raiding Humans and Merchants Guild, or by loot in ordinary
combat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bonus 1:&nbsp; Build an Altar of Storms and train 2 or more
Sorcerers to support the Thunderguard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bonus 2:&nbsp; Capture a Heavy Weapons Armory and destroy
at least 10 enemies with cannons&#39; Grenade ammo or steam-powered melee weapons.</p>
<h3 align="left"><i>Blood Price</i></h3>
<p align="left">You are a favored privateer and bounty hunter of the
Shadowbroker.&nbsp; Or, you were, as recently as 12 hours ago.&nbsp; Currently
the Broker&#39;s second-best galleon lies broken on the strand, all the treasure in
her hold lost to the depths, with only a drunken posse of goblinoid halfwits
blinking at you for orders.&nbsp; Already you are doing your best to hatch some
schemes - the *Trinimac&#39;s Revenge* will never sail again, so you might as well
start salvaging.&nbsp; You suppose that the Broker can be reasonable,
particularly if he never finds out what actually happened.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Goals:&nbsp; Embark with the &quot;Shipwrecked Longboat&quot;
profile.&nbsp; Build a pirate cove consisting of a waterfront villa, at least 2
raider&#39;s drydocks, 2 freelancer&#39;s guildhalls, and one of each type of
caravanserai bazaar.&nbsp; Cover your debt by acquiring at least 20,000 platinum
coins, plus an additional 5000 for each elapsed game year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Tips:&nbsp; Use the Raider&#39;s docks to capture caravanserai
blueprints; use the Common Bazaar and Shadowbroker&#39;s Bazaar to combine smaller
currencies to gold and platinum.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bonus 1:&nbsp; As a known pirate, coins with your mark are
practically worthless; you may not mint coins at the forge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bonus 2:&nbsp; Rebuild the Shadowbroker&#39;s Galleon, a
fortress suspended above the waves with housing for at least 7, galley, sickbay,
barracks, captain&#39;s quarters, and a ballista.</p>
