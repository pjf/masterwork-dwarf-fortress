<title>Orc Fortress</title>
<body>

<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>Orc Fortress is a plug in which builds on the foundation of Meph's Masterwork
Dwarf Fortress and of course on Bay12 Games' Dwarf Fortress itself.  It also
uses a few item assets, building designs, and concepts which originated in
other great mods including Genesis, Kobold Camp, Legends of Forlorn Realms, and
!!Science!!.  Thanks to all who share their work on the forums and in
particular to Hugo<em>the</em>dwarf, Deon, Phoebus, Narhiril, Urist da Vinci, i2amroy,
Putnam, Wrex, gwathlobal; whoever made the Orc sprites; and the general
combined experience and wisdom of the Bay12 forums.  Any components of Orc
Fortress that are my original work I am certainly happy if they are freely
reused and recycled, in fact that is one of my main motivations for posting it.</p>

<p>The Orc in the Logo is by by Eva Zimmermann.</p>

<p>Special thanks to the DFHack team and scripters who make all the cool plugins,
such as expwnent (autosyndrome), Falconne (fortress utility plugins), and
Putnam (itemsyndrome). It is these scripts that make advanced weapons and magic
system possible!</td> Particular thanks to Wrex for detailed testing and
development of orcish weapons.</p>

<p>Particular thanks to gwathlobal for detailed testing of armor and materials.</p>

<p>Particular thanks (again) to Putnam for allowing us to use his language file
transcription of Mordor-speech.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Meph for invaluable help and advice on many occassions.  And also, thanks to all the rest of the Masterwork community for your feedback, patience, modding tips and solutions, and for generally being awesome.</p>

<p>Extra special thanks to Tarn Adams and Bay 12 Games, for developing this unique, wonderful, and slightly insane world and making it so moddable!  Please consider supporting ongoing development at http://bay12games.com/support.html .</p>
