<p>The Caravanserai are a set of 4 bazaars that buy and sell goods for coin.  The Caravanserai can only be built by a clan that has proved itself in combat, and requires a standard of honor to be built.  These traders can help you profit while decluttering your Fort by buying all sorts of goods
such as food, cloth, leather, and weapons from your base in exchange for cold,
hard cash. You can turn around and buy stuff with the coins, or even with coins
you mint. The bazaars mostly deal in the traditional currency of copper,
silver, and gold coins; which can be broken into Orcish shillings at the
Freelancer's Guild. A few high-end transactions are forbidden by the
international Caravanserai charter, and these must only be conducted in
platinum currency available at the Shadowbroker.</p>

<p>The Common Bazaar lets you sell cloth and leather, exchange low value coins to high, and buy anvils and
crates of metal. You can also invite immigration and caravans to your fortress by paying the Caravaners to spread the word.</p>

<p>The Farmers Bazaar lets you sell food and booze, buy wicker,
potash, and gypsum, and buy seed packets. You can buy surface, cave, and boreal
seeds which are collected by master gardeners for use in certain biomes.
There's also a "poisoner's packet," for discerning customers.</p>

<p>The Arms Bazaar let you sell junk armor, although the price is a low fixed rate
(so if it's a good material or decorated, you might want to dispose it a
different way). You can also buy arrows, mechanisms, trap components, and
import weapons not common to Orc domestic markets like crossbows and
warhammers.</p>

<p>The Shadowbroker helps you acquire platinum coins for special
transactions, acquire certain tools whose sale falls outside the bounds of
economic treaty law, and facilitates immigration of goblins &amp; kobolds and the
ransom of captives from hostile civilizations.</p>
