<p><code>[PREFSTRING: tribal heritage]</code>
<code>[PREFSTRING: dedication to vengeance]</code></p>

<p>Seven proud members of the orcish clan have gathered to subdue this new
homeland for the horde.  Hungry dire-wolves roam this land, but it will be
safer than the mithril spears of the pursuing elves, or the terrible dwarven
machines that now rule the underdark.  Your only allies are the cruel goblins,
and perhaps a few bands of exiled criminals from the higher races.  You had
better build a stout fort soon to establish these new hunting grounds, since
the sea serpents and drakes are plenty.   A new chapter of Orcish history will
be written here at <em>Bindrock</em> -- written in blood if need be.</p>

<p>For survival!  For vengeance!  To WAAAAAAAAGH!</p>
