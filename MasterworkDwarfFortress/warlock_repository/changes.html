    <tr>
      <td width="665"><h1 align="center"><a name="aa" id="aa">Warlocks</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Witches and Warlocks are the rulers of your dungeon. They need to eat, drink and sleep like any other creature, but they are immortal and don't age. When a warlocks body dies, take good care of the corpse, because it is possible to bring them back from the dead. This power comes at a price. Warlocks can not reproduce in the traditional way, there are no children.</p>
        <p align="center">Warlocks are natural necromancers and can raise the dead around them, if told to do so. They fight with wraithblades and magestaves, having a natural skill in those weapons. They detest normal weaponry and wont learn these skills.</p>
        <p align="center">They do shy away from manual labor, and mostly to Research, Writing, Alchemy and Chemistry, Herbalism, Medical Experiments, Working with Gems, Trading and what they might call 'Diplomacy', which consists of luring other races to their dungeons.</p>
        <p align="center">Warlocks are the only caste that can become a noble, with the exception of the Steward.</p>
        <p align="center">Their main weapon is magic. In the extensive libraries they can learn up to 100 different spells, from all schools of magic.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="bb" id="bb">Skeletons</a></h1>
        <p align="center">The backbone of your fort. Skeletons do most of the menial labors, like woodcutting, mining and crafting. They are unable to learn new skills besides fighting and move rather slowly. They never eat, drink or sleep, making them a cheap workforce.</p>
        <p align="center">Immune to stun, exertion, fevers, poisons and most other status effects, they are a slow and methodical army. They learn combat skills with a 50% learn-rate, with the exception of whips, which require fast movements from the user.</p>
        <p align="center">You can animate corpses into new skeletons, or build new ones from bones, animating them with a soul.</p>
        <p align="center">Skeletons come in 4 castes: Bone, Ironbone, Bloodsteel and Dreadnought. Each caste gets 2 points in natural skills and 25% higher learn rates than the previous. Their bones are made of the materials, which essentially gives them natural armor. The natural ratio is 1000:100:10:1, but you can manufacture your own upgraded skeletons in the Corrupted Forge.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc" id="cc">Ghouls</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Ghouls are vicious, corpse-eating creatures. They need to eat meat, drink and sleep. Unlike your skeletal servants, ghouls move very quickly. They have natural hunting and fishing skills and can improve these skills. They make good shock-troopers, having natural skill for whips. </p>
<p align="center">Ghoul saliva turns bitten creatures into zombies after a while, so even unarmed they make a good early military.</p>
        <p align="center">Ghouls might migrate to your fort, or you turn captured invaders into new ghouls in your Torture Chamber.</p>
        <p align="center">Ghouls can be turned into powerful, but uncontrollable Thralls in the Thrall Chamber.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc2" id="cc2">Vampires</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Vampires are more welcome in a warlock dungeon then in other forts. While some might arrive hidden and still follow their own agenda, many vampires openly arrive as migrants and make no secret of their identity. As long as the dungeon produces enough blood or blood wine, they will not quench their on your warlocks or ghouls. </p>
        <p align="center">Vampires are quick, relentless, don't require food or sleep, can learn both magic and use the magical warlock-weaponry. They may also become nobles, making them a great addition to your dungeon.</p>
        <p align="center">Vampire Crypts allow the manual conversion of civ-members into vampires, as well as  manual feeding.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="dd" id="dd">Undead Pets</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Warlocks don't do pets.</p>
        <p align="center">Caravans are usually attacked by the living dead before they can trade you any, the embark selection is empty, you can make neither nest-boxes nor hives. If you want pets, you have only two options:</p>
        <p align="center">Rare Evil Creatures at embark. Sometimes a warlock civ tames creatures that live in evil biomes, like gravecats, barghests, brook trolls... Warlocks make sure that these are not attacked by the undead, and you can buy and embark with them. Its a rare occasion though.</p>
        <p align="center">Create your own. Warlocks can create many undead servants directly in your dungeon. Animated weapons, zombies, changelings, soul wisps, subdued demons and horrible abominations of flesh and bone.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="nn" id="dd2">Nobles</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Warlock nobles are way different from what you are used to.</p>
        <p align="center">Only Warlocks and vampiric Warlocks can become nobles, with the exception of the lowly Steward and the militia captians. You can appoint all nobles from the very beginning, but they require rooms and furniture, most of them wont to labors, and they have mandates and demands. Take care not to anger them.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Steward</strong>: You start the dungeon with this noble. He or she can be of any race, even a Skeleton or Ghoul, and requires nothing but a meager office. He will talk to foreign diplomats and run the mundane parts of the dungeon. <em>// I would have liked to get rid of this, but one elected noble is necessary in the game, no way around it, to appoint all following nobles. He has no special graphics.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/harbinger.PNG" width="30" height="33" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Harbinger</strong>: The leader of your dungeon.  He will lead a squad of up to 100 soldiers. He has 3 demands and 3 mandates and requires full suits of rooms, offices, dining room and tombs,  cant be punished and won't do physical labor.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/fleshmonger.PNG" width="32" height="34" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Fleshmonger</strong>: Your doctor. He  runs  your hospital. He needs an office, dining room, bedroom and tomb; he has 1 demand and 1 mandate. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/keeper.PNG" width="30" height="33" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Keeper of Knowledge</strong>: Takes care of your books. He acts like your broker, bookkeeper and manager in one. He needs an office, dining room, bedroom and tomb; he has 1 demand and 1 mandate,  and won't do physical labor.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/mistress.PNG" width="30" height="32" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Mistress</strong>: Can only be female. Acts as your law enforcer and executioner, using a whip as weapon of choice.  She acts like your sheriff, hammerer and psychiatrist, meeting unhappy workers to talk to them. Needs an office, dining room, bedroom and tomb; she has 1 demand and 1 mandate,</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/Riders.PNG" width="127" height="32" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Death, Hunger, Pestilence and War</strong>: Four militia captians, which can lead a squad of 1 unit. Themselves. These positions should be filled with powerful mages or individual highly trained and equipped ghouls or skeletons. It is more of an atmospheric point, when you say: I had it was this FB in my caverns, I am sending Death to take it down. The Riders of the Apocalypse do not do menial labor and require a tomb.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/ghouls militia.PNG" width="32" height="32" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Ghoul Master</strong>: Your Ghoul military leader. He can lead a squad of up to 25 wrestlers and whip-using ghouls. He only requires a tomb.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="icons/skeleton militia.PNG" width="32" height="32" alt="harbinger" /> <strong>Crypt Lord</strong>: Your Skeleton military leader. He can lead a squad of up to 25 skeletons and archers. He only requires a tomb.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Non-Appointable: Monarch, Diplomat and Merchants. </strong></p>
        <p align="center">The monarch will lead your home-civ and might even show up in your fort. He is literally the same as a dwarven monarch, just renamed to 'Master Sorcerer'. Mostly just used for world-gen.</p>
        <p align="center">Diplomats might show up once a year and act like any other diplomat of any other civ. No changes here. They are called 'Emissary'.</p>
        <p align="center">Merchants would usually show up with caravans to trade, but warlock civs do not have access to pull animals for wagons, or pack animals to carry tradegoods, therefore your civ is always 'no-trade'. Merchants shouldnt be possible. If you do happen to see one, he will be called 'Shady Merchant'.</p>
