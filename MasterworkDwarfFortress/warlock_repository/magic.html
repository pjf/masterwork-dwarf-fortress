        <h1 align="center"><a name="aa" id="aa">Souls &amp; Scalps</a>        </h1>
        <p align="center">All butchered creatures will drop a soul and a scalp. Both items can't be stockpiled and only exist temporarily. They will wither or rot away after 2-4 weeks.</p>
        <p align="center">You can make souls stable by storing them in hourglasses, making so called Phylacteries. This is done in the Soul Syphon. Souls or Phylacteries are the basic currency of Warlocks and are used from raising dead, over summoning creature to powerful rituals.</p>
        <p align="center">Scalps can be made stable with the &quot;Make skin from scalp&quot; reaction in the Tanner. These race-specific skins are your materials for books or armor decorations. Dwarf-skin decorated armor helps fight dwarves for example. Books are needed for libraries, spells and learning. See the next paragraph.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="bb" id="bb">Libraries &amp; Books</a></h1>
        <p align="center">One of the main building blocks of a Warlock dungeon is the Library. There are 9 different workshops for this. You start with the Library - Center. It allows you to write books, unlocking all the other libraries. </p>
        <p align="center">Each library has a specific topic and can write 2 special books, which unlock new buildings. All workshops in the Lair and High-Ritual section need such books. If you embark on a Necromancers tower, you can even use their books to quickly build a library or two. The Academy can teach skills by using books. This is a great place to get rid of extra books, in case you already have everything unlocked.</p>
        <p align="center">You can also teach spells in the library section. See the next paragraph.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="cc" id="cc">Spells</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Spells are only for Warlocks. Each Warlock starts with the slade-boulder spell, but they can learn dozens of new spells. You assign the Warlock to the library, bring the reagents and after the reaction is finished, your Warlock will be able to cast the selected spell. </p>
        <p align="center">You will not get any notification about this, but the Dwarf Therapist should be able to show you the learned spells, they show as active syndromes. You can even teach a Warlock the same spell several times, for example if you teach him Fireball 3 times, he can cast 3 fireballs at the same time.</p>
        <p align="center">Spells cost many alchemical reagents, candles and herbs and such. Most of them come from the Alchemist. </p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="alc" id="cc3">Alchemy</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Your Alchemist uses raw materials to make ritual and spell reagents. Its a very simple system: Gem Dust, Shredded Plants, Wood Splinters and Ore Dust go in, ritual reagent comes out. Usually its three things for one item. For example 3 shredded plants make 1 bag of herbs, or 3 bags of gem dust make 1 gem sigil.</p>
        <p align="center">What is this dust/shredded stuff? Its material that ended up in the shredders. You have 6 workshops in the Industry section. A sawmill, a bonemill, a wood shredder, ore shredder, plant shredder and gem shredder. Warlocks just chuck all the raw materials in, and get their reagents out. You will need a lot of bags for this.</p>
        <p align="center">In the end you simply strip-mine the entire map and throw it all in.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="uu" id="cc4">Controlling Undeads</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Undead units will most likely appear sooner or later. Both uncontrollable, like Zombies, and controllable, like Skeletons. </p>
        <p align="center">Uncontrollable opposed-to-life creatures will not attack you. But they will roam the map and attack invaders, ambushes and wildlife. They are not very strong, since they use the undead hitpoint system and dont carry equipment.</p>
        <p align="center">Controlable Skeletons are a lot more interesting. They do labors and learn combat skills. You can build your own at the Necromantic Altar, but if they run too far from the Warlocks, they turn opposed-to-life as well. When that happens you need to bring a Warlock nearby to retake control. Or you build a network of Pylons, which is explained in the Warlock-Section of the manual.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="rr" id="cc2">Raiding</a></h1>
        <p align="center">A good source of scalps and souls are raids. In your Throne Room you can appoint an Overlord, who can in turn command his minions to do raids. This is all done in reactions, there are no actual minions involved. You can pick a target and a command, and watch the show. In the end you will be rewarded with either loot, prisoners or scalps.</p>
        <p align="center">Raiding only needs some raiding kits from the Craftsmans Shop, and some piece of intel. Where do you get intel? I am glad you asked. See the Prisoner Section below.</p>
<hr />
        <h1 align="center"><a name="dd" id="dd">Prisoners</a></h1>
        <p align="center">Prisoners are live creatures and count as pets. You can butcher them for scalps, meat and souls, but you have an entire industry based on them: The Dungeon. It consists of four workshops; the Interrogation Room, the Torture Chamber, the Dungon Cell and the Execution Chamber.</p>
        <p align="center">You can strip-search your prisoners to look for hidden items or intel, or torture them to reveal more info. You can identify that info in the Interrogation Room and see if it is any help for your raids. You might get valuable info about a caravan, church, village, town or castle this way.</p>
        <p align="center">Prisoners are injured by being tortured, and you might want to try to heal them up now and then. The Dungeon Cell allows just that, as well as feeding them. </p>
        <p align="center">The Execution Chamber makes a quick end of them, spawning a free Pain Elemental. </p>
        <p align="center">In the end you do raids, get prisoners, torture them, get intel, do better raids, get more prisoners, rinse and repeat. You will always have to ask yourself: Should I butcher the prisoner now, or try one more time for more intel? </p>
