<h1>The Savagery Map Tab.</h1>
This tab generates the savagery map which determines the general
strength of the creatures living in the tile.<br>

The Zoom Level control will zoom in all maps associated with this tab.
Zooming in will change the size of the edit brush so that the edit
reticle cursor always shows the extent of the brushes effect.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Percent Below Benign Threshold&rsquo; slider
controls the lowest savagery threshold. Savagery levels below this are
considered &lsquo;benign&rsquo;. <br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Percent Below Neutral Threshold&rsquo; slider
controls the next savagery threshold. Levels below this are considered
&lsquo;neutral&rsquo; and levels above this are considered
&lsquo;savage&rsquo;. Keep in mind that civilizations generally
will not settle in savage areas, so if you use a lot of savagery you
should also use a lot of noise so that civs aren&rsquo;t bottled
into a corner where they destroy each other.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Savagery Gradient Type&rsquo; control allows you to
set the gradient type for the savagery map. The four gradient types are
currently increasing east, increasing west, or two radial gradients
that increase or decrease depending on the distance from a place on the
map.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Gradient Center Point&rsquo; controls allow you to
set the center of the radial gradients. They have no effect on the
linear gradients. The &lsquo;hand&rsquo; button will allow you
to easily choose a center point with the mouse.<br>
<br>
The noise map control is the same as on other tabs.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;weight&rsquo; slider governs how much of this noise
map is added to the final map.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Feature Size&rsquo; slider adjusts the size of the
features in the noise field. The higher the number, the smaller the
features get. If that seems awkward, the slider is actually controlling
&lsquo;frequency&rsquo; directly, and size indirectly as a
result of frequency.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Smoothness&rsquo; slider adjusts the smoothness of
the noise field.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Generate New&rsquo; buttons scramble the noise
inputs to create a new noise field.<br>
<br>
You may also click and drag on the noise fields to adjust their
position in case you want a certain feature to appear in a specific
location.<br>
