# «☼Masterwork Dwarf Fortress - Studded with Patches☼»

This is a community driven branch of Meph's excellent
*Masterwork Dwarf Fortress*.

## Playing

If all you want to do is play, you can download one of two
ready-to-go zip files:

* The [master release](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/archive/master.zip) contains all bugfixes and improvements which are considered stable. It is always based upon the most recently release of Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.

* The [unified release](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/archive/unified.zip) is the same as the master release, but also includes *experimental features and bugfixes*. Things don't get placed into unified until we're pretty sure they work, so it's recommended for most users, but occasionally things will still be a bit rough around the edges.

If you already have the latest release of Dwarf Fortress, you can
download patch files *should* update your distributions to the
Studded With Patches versions of the files. These are automatically
generated, and are not guaranteed to work. If in doubt, use the
zips above:

* [master release (patches only)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9702672/MWDF/MWDF-patch-master.zip)
* [unified release (patches only)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9702672/MWDF/MWDF-patch-unified.zip)

5. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/compare/), or point me to your changes [on the forum](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=133174.0)
6. Celebrate, because you're awesome!

If you're an advanced git user, you're encouraged to use feature
branches if you're going to be making a lot of related changes. Likewise
we suggest you make your changes based upon master, or a feature branch
your changes depend upon (like `dfhack_r4`), as the unified branch is
really just an amalgan of features, rather than a proper development
branch in and of itself.

If you're still new to git, don't worry about the preceeding paragraph.
Just do what feels best; git makes it easy to apply patches to the
right place. However we do encourage you to commit early and often;
little commits each making a set of related changes are easier to manage
than larger commits which may involve changing different features.
