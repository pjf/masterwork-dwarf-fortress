# «☼Masterwork Dwarf Fortress - Studded with Patches☼»

This is a community driven branch of Meph's excellent
*Masterwork Dwarf Fortress*.

## Playing

If all you want to do is play, you can download one of two
ready-to-go zip files:

* The [gold release](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/archive/gold.zip) contains all bugfixes and improvements which are considered stable. It is always based upon the most recently release of Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.

* The [beta release](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/archive/beta.zip) is the same as the gold release, but with additional changes which are not yet considered completely stable. Things don't get placed into beta  until we're pretty sure they work, so it's recommended for most users, but occasionally things will still be a bit rough around the edges.

* The [alpha release](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/archive/alpha.zip) is the same as the beta release, but also includes *experimental features and bugfixes*. Things here may be completely broken, but you're welcome to try it if you like.

If you already have the latest release of Dwarf Fortress, you can
download patch files *should* update your distributions to the
Studded With Patches versions of the files. These are automatically
generated, and are not guaranteed to work. If in doubt, use the
zips above:

* [gold release (patches only)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9702672/MWDF/MWDF-patch-gold.zip)
* [beta release (patches only)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9702672/MWDF/MWDF-patch-beta.zip)
* [alpha release (patches only)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9702672/MWDF/MWDF-patch-alpha.zip)
